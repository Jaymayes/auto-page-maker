Acknowledged. QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.3 is accepted as the canonical Gate 0 baseline. Timeline and weekdays verified in UTC. Platform remains NO-GO until the Gate 0 decision.

Executive directives (effective immediately)

PMO

Post the final timeline mapping table and DRI owners within 60 minutes; pin in #gate0-war-room.
Stand up the Control-Tower daily cadence: 16:30 UTC pre-brief, 17:45 UTC post-brief through Fri Oct 10.
Enforce Evidence Hygiene: every artifact must include run_id, data window (UTC), source link, and owner; file naming: YYYYMMDD_HHMM_UTC_DRI_artifact.ext.
Deviation Protocol: if any EOD deliverable risks missing quality/scope/time, file an exception by 20:00 UTC with mitigation, new deadline, and quantified impact.
EOD Today (Sat Oct 4, 23:59 UTC) deliverables

Engineering Lead: publish P95/P99 latency vs 120ms P95 SLO, 99.9% uptime, abort thresholds, and rollback SLA; include canary rehearsal artifacts and saturation headroom analysis.
SRE: post current error budget remaining and 1h/6h burn-rate indicators; top 3 reliability risks with mitigations.
QA Lead: confirm Sev-1 model-behavior definition applied; run guardrail/bias battery; produce redline roll-up and sample error cases.
Growth/SEO: report Auto Page Maker velocity (pages/day, acceptance rate) and indexation % trend; low-CAC acquisition trendline.
Legal: publish data residency map, breach notification SLAs by jurisdiction, and DPA/counterparty status tracker.
Control-Tower dashboards (live by 18:00 UTC today and pinned)

SLO: P95/P99, uptime, error rate, error budget remaining, WoW dips >10%.
SEO: indexation %, Auto Page Maker velocity (pages/day, acceptance rate).
Revenue: $0.01 trace, 3% provider fee capture, ARPU, free→paid conversion.
Finance: week-to-date burn vs plan; flag variances >5% and anomalies.
Evidence packs and decision flow

Evidence packs due Thu Oct 9, 18:00 UTC. Each pack must conclude with a quantitative GO/NO-GO recommendation from the DRI and link to underlying datasets.
CEO pre-read: Thu Oct 9, 20:00–22:00 UTC. Must-fix comments returned by 22:30 UTC. No changes after 22:30 UTC except via Deviation Protocol.
Gate 0 decision: Fri Oct 10 (30 min). Agenda: 5 min executive summary, 10 min exceptions, 10 min Q&A, 5 min decision. Attendees: DRIs only.
One-page executive summary (no slides)

Required sections: Current status vs 7 Gate 0 criteria; SLO/quality summary; SEO/revenue KPIs; finance burn vs $60k plan; red lines pass/fail; open risks (with owners and due dates); hyperlinks to evidence packs.
Decision framework (reaffirmed; zero waivers)

GO requires all 7 Gate 0 criteria GREEN with quantitative evidence, zero Sev-1 incidents in last 7 days, weekly burn ≤ $60k plan, and all 5 red lines PASS.
Any single failure = automatic NO-GO. Enter Safe Mode (max 1 week), DRI remediation, daily standups, re-review next Friday.
Finance and revenue

Finance to publish WTD burn, forecast-to-plan, and anomaly log by 19:00 UTC daily.
Revenue DRI to deliver 30/60/90 forecast with variance to $10M ARR trajectory in the evidence pack; include ARPU, free→paid conversion, active providers, and 3% fee realization.
Communications

All posts to #gate0-war-room with [DRI] [Artifact] [run_id] in the title; tag @PMO for logging and @CEO only for exceptions or red-line risks.
Response SLAs per report are in force; PMO to track and escalate breaches.
I will hold the bar exactly as written. PMO: confirm in-channel when the timeline mapping table is pinned and EOD deliverable trackers are live. DRIs: acknowledge receipt of this directive and confirm your EOD submission status by 18:00 UTC. Execute.
