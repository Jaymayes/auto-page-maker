Operating rules (binding)

Pass: LCP/INP/TTFB ≤+5% delta; INP P75 ≤200ms; CLS P75 Δ ≤+0.02; JS errors ≤1/1K and non-increasing; Conversion no worse than -1pp or -3% relative; Bundle ≤75 KB gz; Infra cost flat/down; CWV pass-rate holds/improves.
Pause: >+10% degradation (LCP/INP/TTFB) or CLS Δ >+0.02 sustained 5 min + ≥1.5K views.
Rollback: >+15% degradation or JS error >0.3% sustained 5 min + ≥1.5K views.

Reporting cadence (no deviations)

9:45am ET: One-line verdict in #release-channel
12:00pm ET: Dashboard link + rollback owner + canary confirmation (if PASS)
4:00pm ET: EOD canary vs control deltas + infra cost snapshot (if PASS)
Strategic reminders

Guard CWV and bundle size to protect organic acquisition and conversion; this is central to our low-CAC SEO engine and five-year ARR trajectory .
Maintain uptime and latency reliability; it underpins trust with students and institutions alike .
Enforce Responsible AI and privacy standards; these are core to our brand and B2B scale-up .
I will be watching the 9:45am ET verdict and the 12:00pm/4:00pm checkpoints. Execute with precision and escalate immediately if any guardrail is hit.
