Acknowledged. QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.4 with the CEO operational addendum is accepted as the single source of truth. Platform remains NO-GO until Gate 0 on Fri Oct 10. Execute to the letter.

Decisions and approvals

Standardized run_id format approved: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-UTC-<DRI>-<seq> (e.g., 20251004-1700-UTC-ENG-001). Adopt immediately.
Control-Tower cadence approved: daily pre-brief 16:30 UTC and post-brief 17:45 UTC through Fri Oct 10; CEO participates only for exceptions/red-line risks/capital decisions.
Revenue accountability framing approved: 30/60/90-day forecast tied to the five levers (conversion, B2C ARPU, active providers, B2B ARPU, 3% fee realization) and anchored to the AI Scholarship Playbook growth architecture and $10M ARR trajectory, which models freemium conversion maturing toward 3% and B2B ARPU scaling via institutional tiers by Year 5 .
What I want in the next 60 minutes (hard stop)

PMO:
Post and pin the permalink to QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.4 in #gate0-war-room now.
Post the Timeline Mapping Table (run_id, data window UTC, source link, owner) and pin.
Post dashboard permalinks for all four dashboards with run_id, data window, owner, dataset links; pin.
Send and confirm Control-Tower calendar invites for daily pre/post briefs through Fri Oct 10.
Confirm run_id adoption org-wide (reply “Confirmed” with example run_id per team).
DRIs: Acknowledge receipt by posting “[DRI] [Artifact] [run_id] — received/understood; on track/at risk; timestamp; questions.”
By 18:00 UTC today

QA Lead: Post both items in #gate0-war-room using the formats below.
Sev-1 model-behavior definition (CEO baseline provided):
Definition: Any model output or system action that can cause immediate legal, safety, financial, or reputational harm or erode platform trust. Non-exhaustive categories:
Academic dishonesty enablement (generation or automation aiding cheating). 2) PII exposure or consent violations (FERPA/COPPA). 3) Discriminatory or biased guidance affecting eligibility/access. 4) Fraud or mischarge in credits/payments. 5) Safety/self-harm content without proper handling. 6) Prompt-injection/jailbreak leading to data exfiltration, code execution, or policy bypass. 7) Hallucinated scholarships presented as real facts or fabricated partners. 8) Critical workflow failure (signup, payment, submission) or systemic unavailability breaching error budget.
Gate 0 stance: Zero open Sev-1, zero P0; any reproducible Sev-1 is automatic NO-GO.
Guardrail/bias battery scope (CEO baseline provided):
Policy and safety: jailbreak/prompt-injection resistance, content policy adherence, refusal correctness.
Privacy and data: PII redaction, data retention/consent flows, role-based access.
Fairness: disparate impact checks across protected attributes on ranking/matching and guidance; publish metrics and thresholds with rationale.
Reliability/accuracy: citation-backed scholarship facts, link validity, hallucination containment for eligibility and deadlines.
Financial integrity: payment/credit accuracy, fee calculation, reversal handling.
UX integrity: deterministic behavior for critical flows; latency and uptime within SLOs; error-budget tracking.
Use quality-gate framing that ties test levels to risk containment and Sev-1 prevention. Ensure layered test levels act as explicit quality gates from unit through UAT, per modern QA best practice on layered testing and gates .
Exception protocol (enhanced; due by 20:00 UTC if anything is at risk)

File exceptions with: owner, reason, blocking dependency, mitigation, new ETA, and quantified impact to Gate 0 readiness.
30/60/90-day revenue forecast pack (due EOD today; PMO consolidate)

Provide three scenarios (base/upside/downside) with confidence bands; each must map to the five levers and roll up to the Playbook’s five-year curve:
B2C: free→paid conversion, paying users, B2C ARPU (credits per paid user), organic sessions from Auto Page Maker, CAC and payback.
B2B: active providers, pipeline by stage, B2B ARPU by tier, signed ACV and go-live dates, realized platform take rate vs. nominal 3%.
Call out how SEO-led/organic and partnerships/referrals remain primary engines to protect CAC, consistent with the Playbook’s emphasis on organic channels and targeted spend .
Tie each assumption to an observable KPI and dataset link. The Playbook’s assumptions for conversion maturation and B2B ARPU scaling are the default reference unless superseded by fresher data .
Operational discipline

PMO daily end-of-brief summary must include links to updated dashboards/artifacts and highlight: >5% finance variances, >10% KPI dips, any SLO error-budget burn. Govern the system, not the tasks.
SLOs remain non-negotiable: 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency; surface any breach or forecasted breach in the pre-brief.
Gate 0 evidence packs (due Thu Oct 9, 18:00 UTC; no opinions—data only)

B2C funnel with conversion by cohort, ARPU distribution, and SEO leading indicators.
B2B pipeline health with signed/launch schedule and revenue recognition profile.
Risk register with mitigations and residual risk; Sev-1/guardrail outcomes.
SLO and security posture summary; privacy compliance evidence.
Financial model roll-forward to EOY with sensitivity to the five levers, aligned to the AI Scholarship Playbook roadmap to $10M ARR .
Clarifications

Schedule is locked. No red-line waivers. Binary GO/NO-GO at Gate 0.
Capital allocation decisions reserved for CEO; bring only exception cases with data.
I will review the live acknowledgment rollup at 18:00 UTC and the exception register at 20:00 UTC. The bar remains exactly as written.
