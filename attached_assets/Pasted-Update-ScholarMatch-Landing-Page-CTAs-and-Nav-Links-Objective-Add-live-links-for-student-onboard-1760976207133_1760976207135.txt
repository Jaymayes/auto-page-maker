Update ScholarMatch Landing Page CTAs and Nav Links

Objective
Add live links for student onboarding and provider onboarding to accelerate both funnels with clear, trustworthy CTAs, zero layout shift, and trackable analytics.

Scope
Landing page header, hero section, and footer. Maintain existing design tokens, spacing, and accessibility standards.

Changes

Header (sticky)

Primary CTA (students): “Get My Matches” → link to https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=header_student
Secondary CTA (providers): “List a Scholarship” → link to https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=header_provider
Mobile: both CTAs appear in the hamburger overlay with 48x48px minimum touch targets.
Hero section

Primary button: “Get My Matches” → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=hero_student
Secondary button: “Browse All” → existing route
Tertiary text link below buttons (12–14px, neutral color, underlined on hover): “Are you a scholarship provider? List your scholarship” → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=hero_provider
Maintain smart urgency, trust indicators, and zero layout shift. Buttons stack on mobile.
Footer

For Students: add “Get My Matches” → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=footer_student
For Providers: add “List a Scholarship” → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=pilot_launch&utm_content=footer_provider
Accessibility and UX

aria-labels:
“Get My Matches — Student pilot”
“List a Scholarship — Provider registration”
Focus states must meet WCAG AA contrast. Maintain keyboard navigation order.
External links open in a new tab with rel="noopener" to preserve session: target="_blank" rel="noopener"
Analytics and Events

Fire events on click with location metadata:
click_student_pilot_cta { location: header|hero|footer }
click_provider_register_cta { location: header|hero|footer }
Preserve existing analytics stack; do not introduce layout shift or block rendering.
Performance and QA

No increase in initial bundle size; reuse existing button components and tokens.
CLS remains ≤ 0.1; FCP target ≤ 2.5s.
Test on breakpoints sm, md, lg, xl for proper stacking and spacing.
Implement behind feature flag pilot_links_v1 (default ON in production). If toggled OFF, revert to previous CTAs without errors.
Acceptance Criteria

Desktop and mobile show student and provider entry points as specified.
All links resolve and carry UTM parameters.
Events appear in analytics with correct labels and locations.
Lighthouse scores and current CLS unaffected; FCP not degraded.
Business Rationale (for context)

Supports dual-engine growth: lowers friction for student onboarding and adds a clear provider path from the highest-traffic page.
Enables measurement: compares header vs hero vs footer CTRs for both funnels to inform future placement and copy tests.
If you want, I can provide variant copy for A/B tests on the provider CTA (“List a Scholarship” vs “Post a Scholarship” vs “Become a Provider”) to optimize CTR without impacting design.
