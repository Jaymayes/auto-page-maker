Control-Tower cadence (effective immediately)

Pre-brief (16:30 UTC, 15 min, data-only)
SLOs: uptime, P95/P99 latency, error-budget burn, forecasted breaches.
SEO: crawl/indexing velocity, impressions, CTR, top-20 pages delta.
Revenue: B2C/B2B daily deltas, ARPU, conversion.
Finance: >5% variances, margin vs 4x AI services markup, 3% provider fee.

Post-brief (17:45 UTC, 10 min, decisions/blocks)
Exceptions, approvals, capital asks; explicit owner and ETA per block.
Operational guardrails (non-negotiable)

SLOs: 99.9% uptime; ~120ms P95 latency. Surface any breach or forecasted breach in the same-day pre-brief.
Responsible AI: no academic dishonesty enablement; enforce FERPA/COPPA/GDPR; bias mitigation and transparency required.

Capital allocation

Reserved to CEO. Any exception request must include: ROI model, risks, impact across the five growth levers.
