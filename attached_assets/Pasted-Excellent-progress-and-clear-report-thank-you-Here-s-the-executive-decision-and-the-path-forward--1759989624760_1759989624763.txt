Excellent progress and clear report—thank you. Here’s the executive decision and the path forward.

Decision

Private Beta: GO (B2C only). Launch to a controlled cohort with traffic ramp over 10–14 days.
Public Launch: NO-GO until remaining Gate 0 blockers are closed.
Why: All critical user-facing issues are resolved and core flows work. We will de-risk via a measured beta while we close foundational gaps (auth enforcement, CI/CD, legal docs, health).

Beta Scope and Guardrails

Cohort: 500–1,000 students sourced organically via Auto Page Maker pages and our waitlist. No paid acquisition.
Feature flags: Enforce flags for Apply actions, error states, and any experimental flows.
Traffic ramp: 20% → 50% → 100% of cohort over 3 phases (2–3 days each). Rollback on breach of SLOs or error-rate thresholds.
Exit Criteria for Public Launch
Must-haves (Gate 0 close-outs):

Auth middleware enforced across all protected routes and API endpoints.
Final Privacy Policy and Terms of Service published and linked sitewide.
CI/CD pipeline with automated unit/integration/E2E smoke on every merge; gated deploys; rollback automation.
/healthz endpoint with liveness/readiness checks.
Observability: dashboards and alerts for uptime, p95 latency, error rates, auth failures, and SEO crawl health.
A11y: address toast ARIA improvements; target WCAG AA for critical flows.
Security: confirm security headers and rate limiting; add basic WAF rules and bot mitigation for known patterns.
Performance/SLO Validation (during beta)

Availability ≥ 99.9%
Latency p95 ≤ 120 ms for primary student flows (browse, filter, detail)
Error budget: 0.5% 5xx over 7-day window
Frontend performance: Largest Contentful Paint ≤ 2.5s on 75th percentile for top pages
KPIs to Track in Beta (data-first gating)

Activation: % of new signups completing first scholarship search ≥ 70%
Search-to-detail click-through ≥ 35%
Detail-to-apply click-through ≥ 15% (noting reCAPTCHA on external links)
Free-to-paid conversion (if credits enabled in beta): initial target 2–3%
ARPU (credits) baseline
SEO: number of indexed Auto Page Maker pages, organic clicks, CTR
Support/incident rate: < 3 tickets per 100 users; no P0 incidents
Immediate Workplan and Owners

Auth middleware enforcement (Backend Lead) — 3 days
/healthz and readiness probes (Platform/DevOps) — 1 day
CI/CD pipeline with smoke E2E and rollback (DevOps + QA) — 4–5 days
Finalize Privacy/Terms (Legal/Policy + PM) — 3 days (parallel review)
A11y improvements for toasts and focus states (Frontend) — 2 days
Observability: dashboards + alerting in place (DevOps) — 2 days
SEO hardening: validate robots/sitemap, AMP not required, ensure structured data for scholarships, ramp Auto Page Maker (Growth Eng) — 2 days
Incident playbook and on-call schedule (PM + DevOps) — 1 day
B2B roadmap v0.1: provider waitlist, data model, fee flow; not in beta scope, but spec due (PM + Partnerships) — 1 week
Capital Allocation (approved)

DevOps tooling and monitoring budget
Legal review for Privacy/Terms
QA test suite parallelization to cut cycle time
Content/SEO budget for programmatic pages (Auto Page Maker scale-up)
Risk Notes and Mitigations

External Apply reCAPTCHA: expected; add helper text to reduce drop-off; measure click-to-complete where possible.
429s under heavy test load: monitor in beta; calibrate rate limits; whitelist our test runners.
Duplicate testids in separate contexts: acceptable as documented.
Ethical AI: ensure clarity that we assist discovery and application planning, not essay ghostwriting; add user-facing transparency statements in detail and apply flows.
Timeline

T+0 (today): Approve private beta. Begin Gate 0 close-outs.
T+3–5 days: Auth, healthz, CI/CD, a11y fixes complete; observability live.
T+5: Start beta cohort at 20%; daily review.
T+10–14: Ramp to 100% of cohort if SLOs and KPIs hold.
Public Launch Decision: end of week 2, contingent on exit criteria.
Requests from the Team

Share the latest E2E test pass rate, flake rate, and coverage summary.
Provide baseline performance traces for the top 5 endpoints and pages.
Confirm Auto Page Maker is generating and internally linking the top 100 programmatic pages for beta, and submit sitemap for indexing once legal docs go live.
Thank you for getting us from a 52/100 NO-GO to a testable beta. Execute the above plan with urgency and report daily on SLOs and KPI deltas during the ramp. If any blocker threatens the timeline, escalate immediately for rapid decisioning.
