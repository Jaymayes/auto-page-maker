Acknowledged. QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.4 is accepted as the locked Gate 0 canonical artifact. My stance remains unchanged: schedule locked, zero red-line waivers, binary GO/NO-GO at Gate 0, quantitative evidence only. This governance aligns to our five-year plan to reach $10M profitable ARR via the dual B2C/B2B engine and disciplined KPI tracking, including ARPU, conversion, provider growth, and fee capture .

Immediate confirmations required (within 60 minutes)

PMO: Post and pin the timeline mapping table with DRI owners to #gate0-war-room. Include run_id, data window (UTC), source link, and owner for the artifact.
PMO: Post a live acknowledgment rollup showing each DRI’s status (received/understood, on track/at risk, timestamp).
PMO: Ensure calendar invites are live for Control-Tower cadence: 16:30 UTC pre-brief, 17:45 UTC post-brief through Fri Oct 10.
Dashboards: Post permalinks for all 4 dashboards in #gate0-war-room and pin:
SLO Dashboard: P95/P99 vs 120ms SLO, uptime vs 99.9%, error rate, error budget, WoW dips >10%.
SEO Dashboard: Indexation %, Auto Page Maker velocity.
Revenue Dashboard: $0.01 trace, 3% fee capture, ARPU, free→paid conversion, active providers.
Finance Dashboard: WTD burn vs $60k plan, >5% variances, anomaly log. Each dashboard post must include run_id, data window, owner, and link to underlying dataset(s). Our production discipline and monitoring requirements are consistent with our deployment-readiness standards and post-launch observability expectations .
EOD today (Sat Oct 4, 23:59 UTC) deliverables by role

Engineering Lead:
SLOs: P95/P99 vs 120ms, uptime vs 99.9%.
Abort thresholds, rollback SLA, canary rehearsal artifacts, saturation headroom.
SRE:
Error budget remaining, 1h/6h burn rates, top 3 reliability risks with mitigations.
QA Lead:
Sev-1 model-behavior definition, guardrail/bias battery results, redline roll-up, sample error cases. Use a clear quality-gate framing that ties test levels to risk containment and Sev-1 prevention .
Growth/SEO:
Auto Page Maker velocity, indexation % trend, low-CAC acquisition trendline.
Legal:
Data residency map, breach notification SLAs by jurisdiction, DPA/counterparty status tracker.
Exception protocol

If any EOD deliverable is at risk, file an exception by 20:00 UTC with owner, reason, blocking dependency, mitigation, new ETA, and quantitative impact to Gate 0 readiness.
Evidence hygiene and run_id standard

All artifacts must include run_id, data window (UTC), source link, owner, and follow the file naming convention: YYYYMMDD_HHMM_UTC_DRI_artifact.ext.
Effective immediately, run_id format is: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-UTC-<DRI>-<seq>. Example: 20251004-1700-UTC-ENG-001.
PMO: Confirm adoption in #gate0-war-room.
Revenue accountability

Revenue DRI: Ensure the Revenue Dashboard and the Oct 9 evidence pack include the 30/60/90 forecast tied explicitly to our $10M ARR trajectory and levers: free→paid conversion, B2C ARPU, active providers, B2B ARPU, and 3% fee realization. This must map to the financial model and growth architecture in the AI Scholarship Playbook . Our operating cadence must continue to favor organic, SEO-led growth to protect CAC and sustain margin expansion toward the target .
Operational discipline

Control-Tower cadence is live daily (pre/post briefs). I will review only exceptions, red-line risks, or decisions requiring capital allocation.
PMO: Maintain a daily end-of-brief summary in #gate0-war-room with links to updated dashboards and artifacts, highlighting any >5% finance variances, >10% KPI dips, or SLO error-budget burns requiring action. This is consistent with our “govern the system, not the tasks” principle for autonomous operations .
Key upcoming checkpoints

Thu Oct 9
18:00 UTC: One-page Executive Summary due (Engineering Lead).
18:00 UTC: Evidence Pack Enhancements due across DRIs.
20:00–22:00 UTC: CEO pre-read (no interruptions).
22:30 UTC: Must-fix comments deadline; then CHANGE FREEZE, deviations require my sign-off.
Fri Oct 10
Gate 0 Decision Meeting (30 min): Exec summary, exceptions, CEO Q&A, binary GO/NO-GO.
Restatement of decision framework

GO requires all four:
All 7 Gate 0 criteria GREEN with quantitative evidence.
Zero Sev-1 incidents in the last 7 days.
Weekly burn ≤ $60k plan.
All 5 red lines PASS.
Any single failure = automatic NO-GO → Safe Mode (≤1 week) + DRI remediation.
Final requests for today

PMO: Post the permalink to QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.4 in #gate0-war-room now and pin it as the single source of truth.
All DRIs: Acknowledge directives by 18:00 UTC with name/role, status, and questions. Use posting format: [DRI] [Artifact] [run_id].
QA Lead: Post the Sev-1 model-behavior definition and the guardrail/bias battery scope so I can pre-spot any gaps before Oct 9 .
Execute to the letter. The bar remains as written.
