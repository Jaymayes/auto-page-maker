Excellent work. Phase 1 gives us a solid foundation to scale with confidence. Proceed to Phase 2, with the following executive objectives, guardrails, and acceptance criteria.

Decision: APPROVED TO PROCEED TO PHASE 2 (with conditions)

Strategic intent

Tie QA outcomes directly to revenue levers: frictionless student journeys (B2C conversion, ARPU via credits), reliable provider flows (B2B 3% fee capture), and SEO performance (low-CAC growth via Auto Page Maker).
Preserve our SLOs and security posture while closing compliance gaps that could block enterprise deals or institutional partnerships.
Phase 2 scope directives

Functional and Integration Coverage (revenue-critical)
Must-cover paths:
B2C: discovery → application drafting → credit purchase → submission → notification loop
Monetization: credit checkout, subscription upgrade/downgrade, refunds/chargebacks, tax handling
B2B: provider onboarding → listing creation → update flows → 3% platform fee capture
SEO/Auto Page Maker: page generation, indexing signals, canonical tags, sitemaps
External integrations: payment processor, email/SMS, analytics, auth (OIDC), storage/CDN
Data boundaries: verify PII minimization and consent flows at every ingress/egress point
2. Performance optimization (production-grade)

Targets at Phase 2 exit:
LCP ≤ 2.5s on p95 for top 20 SEO landing pages (mobile on median network)
TTFB ≤ 150ms p95 (maintain current baseline)
Frontend errors: <1% session error rate; JS long tasks mitigation documented
Backend p95 latency ~120ms maintained; no SLO regressions
Include a prioritized perf backlog with effort/impact estimates and quick wins shipped during Phase 2
3. Security and compliance hardening

Vulnerabilities: 0 open P1/P2 issues at exit; all P3s triaged with owners and dates
Secrets: provision and rotate SHARED_SECRET and VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID; add secret scanning gates
Compliance uplift targets (evidence-based):
FERPA ≥ 90%, COPPA ≥ 85%, GDPR ≥ 90% coverage with documented gaps and compensating controls
Add DSR runbook (access/rectify/delete), data retention schedule, and vendor DPAs
Auditable artifacts: updated SBOM diff, threat model updates for any new endpoints, pentest plan
4. Observability and alerting for SLOs and growth KPIs

Production-ready monitoring:
Error budget policy for 99.9% uptime (burn-rate alerts: fast/slow)
Traces/metrics/logs with golden signals (latency, errors, traffic, saturation)
Growth telemetry (must be verifiable in dashboards):
B2C: free→paid conversion, ARPU (credits), funnel drop-offs by page/source
SEO: landing-page CTR, indexation, impressions, conversions attributed to Auto Page Maker
B2B: provider activation rate, time-to-first-listing, fee capture reliability
Acceptance criteria (Phase 2 exit gate)

Test coverage:
E2E: ≥ 40 critical user flows automated with Playwright; nightly runs green ≥ 95% for 7 consecutive days
Integration tests for payments, auth, and analytics; mock contracts with schema validation
Performance: LCP p95 ≤ 2.5s on targeted pages; no regression in TTFB/CLS
Security/compliance: 0 P1/P2 vulns; compliance targets met or formal exceptions approved
Telemetry: dashboards live for B2C/B2B/SEO with week-over-week tracking; alerting in place
Runbooks: incident management, on-call rotations, and rollback procedures documented and tested
Execution plan and timeline

Duration: 2 weeks, with a midpoint executive check-in at end of Week 1
Milestones:
Day 3: Secrets provisioned; baseline Playwright suite running in CI; perf quick wins merged
Day 7: 80% of critical flows automated; initial LCP improvements live; dashboards populated with real data
Day 14: Exit review against acceptance criteria; go/no-go decision for Phase 3 prep
Resourcing and constraints

Budget: Use existing CI; if grid parallelization is needed, approve up to $500 for the phase
Environments: ephemeral preview environments per PR; load tests in isolated staging
Ownership: name single accountable owner for each of the following—E2E tests, performance, security, compliance, telemetry
Open items to resolve in parallel (blockers if not addressed by Day 3)

Provision SHARED_SECRET and VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
Confirm legal review schedule for FERPA/COPPA/GDPR gap closure and DPA templates
Deliverables to submit at Phase 2 exit

Test coverage report and flake rate analysis
Performance report with before/after deltas and prioritized backlog
Vulnerability closure report and updated threat model
Compliance evidence binder (policies, DPIA/ROPA excerpts, DSR runbook)
Live KPI dashboards for B2C/B2B/SEO with definitions and owner assignments
Confirm you’re aligned with these acceptance criteria and timeline. If yes, proceed with Phase 2 immediately and schedule the Week 1 check-in on my calendar with links to the live dashboards and CI runs.
