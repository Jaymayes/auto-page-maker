Greenlight to run WebPageTest now.

Why this matters: Core Web Vitals performance is a direct driver of organic growth (Auto Page Maker SEO) and B2C conversions. We will not ship a slow top-of-funnel.

Execution orders (immediate)

Run WPT per your config (Moto G4, Slow 4G, 4x CPU, 3–5 runs, median, cold + 1 repeat view) for:
Landing page (/)
Search/results (logged-out)
Capture artifacts:
Public WPT result links
Filmstrip/video and waterfall
Core Web Vitals: FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT/TTI
Screenshot at LCP
Post results with a brief note: “What was the LCP element? Which JS/CSS blocked first content? Is analytics correctly deferred?”
Go/No-Go gates (interim)

Pass target (greenlight to ship 86 KB bundle baseline):
FCP ≤ 2.4s
LCP ≤ 2.8s
CLS ≤ 0.1
TBT ≤ 300ms
≤ 1 render-blocking JS before first content
Analytics deferred visible in the waterfall
If fail by ≤15% (e.g., LCP ≤ 3.2s or TBT ≤ 345ms):
Execute Cuts 1–2 (lazy-load heavy non-critical widgets; function-level imports)
Rebuild/redeploy; re-run WPT immediately
If fail by >15% (e.g., LCP > 3.2s or TBT > 345ms):
Execute Cuts 1–4 in one pass
Additionally apply these zero/low-risk tweaks before rerun:
Inline or preload only the critical CSS for above-the-fold; defer the rest
font-display: swap; preconnect to font origin or host fonts locally
Ensure hero/LCP image is compressed, correct dimensions, width/height set, and loaded via fetchpriority=high
Verify brotli/gzip enabled and HTTP/2; long-lived cache headers for static assets; no source maps in prod
Remove any unused third-party tags; confirm analytics truly idle-deferred
Re-run WPT
Decision cadence

Post first WPT results within 45 minutes.
If cuts are needed, complete within 30 minutes; re-run WPT; post updated results.
1pm ET: Final go/no-go. If passing, we ship baseline and log tech debt (vite config, vendor splitting, route-level chunking, i18n splitting) for the scheduled optimization sprint.
Owner assignments (for speed)

Perf lead: own WPT runs, artifacts, and LCP/TBT diagnosis
Frontend: execute Cuts 1–4 and the low-risk tweaks
DevOps: verify compression, HTTP/2, caching headers; watch TTFB (goal ≤ 450–500ms; current dev 577ms is a flag)
Analytics: confirm non-blocking load and idle-deferred events
What I want in the report

Median metrics for each page and each view (cold + repeat)
LCP element details and exact resource chain causing delay
Count of render-blocking JS/CSS before first content
Top three opportunities from the waterfall (by blocking time/bytes)
Recommendation: “Ship baseline” or “Apply cuts and rerun,” with ETA
Business lens

If WPT passes: we ship today. Performance is our lever for low-CAC SEO growth and conversion efficiency.
If WPT misses after cuts: halt ship, escalate to a focused 0.5–1 day optimization sprint targeting LCP and TBT on the landing page first, then search.
