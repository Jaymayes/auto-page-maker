Outstanding progress. This is exactly the kind of disciplined, data-first execution we need to hit our SEO-led growth and CAC targets.

Executive decisions and directives

Approvals and targets (Days 2–3)
Approved: Tickets #5–10 as proposed.
Hard performance budgets to enforce in CI/CD:
Initial JS (PWA shell): ≤80KB gz by Day 3; stretch ≤75KB.
Route chunks: ≤30KB gz per major route; ≤15KB gz for landing.
CSS: ≤60KB gz total; critical CSS inline ≤6KB.
Core Web Vitals (P75, mobile): FCP ≤2.2s, LCP ≤2.8s, CLS ≤0.05, TTFB ≤200ms.
Guardrails: zero functional regressions, zero SEO crawlability impacts, no increase in JS runtime errors or chunk load failures.
2. Deployment plan and gates

Stage → Canary 50% only after 24h stable RUM on staging meeting all budgets above.
Canary success criteria over 12–24h:
P75 LCP ≤2.8s in top 3 GEO/device cohorts.
JS errors ≤0.3% of sessions; chunk load failures ≤0.1%.
Bounce rate not worse than baseline; session conversion rate stable or better.
Rollback triggers:
P75 LCP >3.0s or JS initial >95KB gz.
25% regression in route TTI or >0.5% JS error rate spike.

Mitigations: keep pre-optimization bundles hot on CDN; instant rollback path; error boundaries for lazy-loaded routes.
3. Specific priorities to close the last 10–15KB and hit FCP/LCP interim

Ticket #5–6 (size wins):
Remove unused deps; switch Lucide to per-icon ESM imports; verify tree-shaking via bundle analyzer.
Audit and drop polyfills not needed for our supported browsers; prefer native APIs where possible.
Ticket #7–8 (render path):
Inline above-the-fold critical CSS ≤6KB; defer rest with media=“print” swap or rel=“preload” patterns as appropriate.
Ensure hero/LCP image optimization:
Preload the exact LCP asset with fetchpriority="high".
Add explicit width/height; serve AVIF/WebP; set decoding="async".
If SSR/SSG, include correct sizes/srcset to prevent late swaps.
Ticket #9–10 (third parties):
Lazy-load after user interaction; use consent gating.
Self-host minimal pixels where permissible; strip querystring bloat; defer tag manager container; block synchronous scripts on initial paint.
4. Measurement and segmentation

RUM dashboards segmented by:
Device class (low-end Android vs iOS), network (3G/4G), GEO (top 3 markets).
Page type: Landing, ScholarshipCategory, ScholarshipDetail, Apply flow.
Track top LCP element per route; share the top 5 offenders daily.
Add bundle budgets to CI with fail-the-build thresholds matching the budgets above.
5. SEO and growth linkage (why this matters)

Faster LCP/FCP on mobile is a leading indicator for rankings on long-tail “scholarship + intent” pages generated by Auto Page Maker. Expect lower pogo-sticking and higher CTR → lower CAC on organic.
Hypothesis for canary: 10–20% LCP improvement on mobile should correlate with a measurable drop in bounce for cold SEO traffic and a modest uplift in free-to-paid conversion. Run an A/B holdout in canary to quantify.
6. Risk, compliance, and ethics

Third-party scripts must respect consent and data minimization (COPPA/FERPA implications). No fingerprinting. Keep our Responsible AI banner intact; do not degrade accessibility during performance work.
7. Resourcing and capital allocation

Approved: up to 2 engineer-days for a third-party script and iconography audit to land by Day 3.
Contingent investment: If LCP remains >2.8s after Day 3 due to media, pre-approve $200–$500/month for an image CDN (AVIF, responsive variants, origin shielding) with a 30-day trial. Expect ROI via SEO and conversion lift.
8. Deliverables by end of Day 3

Metrics: P75 FCP ≤2.2s, LCP ≤2.8s on mobile; JS ≤80KB gz initial.
Artifacts: bundle analyzer reports (before/after), route-level size table, RUM dashboard links, and a short write-up of any regressions and fixes.
Go/No-Go recommendation for 50% canary with the gating metrics above.
Open asks

Confirm the top LCP element on the homepage and ScholarshipCategory pages.
Share the current top 10 JS modules by gz size and by parse/execute cost.
Confirm device distribution for our mobile audience so we weight RUM cohorts correctly.
Once the Day 3 targets are met, I’ll greenlight 50% canary immediately. Keep velocity high and avoid scope creep—this work directly fuels organic acquisition and lowers CAC.
