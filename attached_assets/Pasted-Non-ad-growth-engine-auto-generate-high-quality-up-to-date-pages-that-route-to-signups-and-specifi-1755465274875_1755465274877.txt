Non-ad growth engine: auto-generate high-quality, up-to-date pages that route to signups and specific scholarships. 

MVP features 

Templates: programmatic pages for “Scholarships for [Major] in [State]”, “No-essay scholarships 2025”, “Local [City] scholarships”. 

Content builder: KG retrieval + LLM to generate unique, factual summaries; include provenance snippets and live deadlines. 

Quality gates: duplicate detection, toxicity checks, minimum facts threshold; human spot-check queue via Command Center. 

Sitemaps and internal linking: dynamic sitemap.xml; breadcrumb and cluster linking; canonical tags; last-mod dates. 

CTAs: contextual “Get matches” and “Apply on platform”; event tracking. 

Analytics: GSC + privacy-friendly web analytics; cohort attribution to signups and applications. 

Stack on Replit 

Next.js with ISR/SSG; background content generator worker; cache invalidation on data updates. 

Switch to usage-based billing with free sign-up Principles 

Students: always free to search, match, save, track, and get email alerts. Pay only when consuming costly AI/automation. Provide generous monthly free credits to ensure access; sponsorships for low-income students. 

Providers/Institutions: pay for compute-heavy and workflow-heavy usage (API, screening, application processing). No ads, no lead-selling. 

Student metered units (suggested) 

Essay assistant: 

Outline generation: 1 unit 

Feedback pass: 1 unit per 800–1,000 words 

Autofill: 

Prefill partner form: 2 units 

Headless submit (where allowed): 5 units 

PDF pack generation: 1 unit 

Strategy planner refresh: 1 unit 

SMS alerts: pass-through cost + small margin 

Monthly free credits: e.g., 20 units/month; top-ups in bundles ($5 for 50 units, $15 for 200 units). Hard monthly spend cap with user control. 

Provider/institution metered units 

API ingestion/write: per 1,000 records (billed monthly, first 5k free). 

Application processing: per application securely delivered (includes storage and logs). 

Auto-screen/scoring: per application scored/summarized (LLM call). 

Managed autofill mapping: per active form/month (covers maintenance). 

Webhooks: free within fair-use; rate-limited beyond. 

Stripe implementation 

Metered products/prices for each unit type. 

Report usage via Stripe’s usage_records for students and providers. 

Wallet UX: show current credits, forecasted month-end charges, soft/hard caps, receipts. 

Free credits issuance per month; promo codes for schools/non-profits. 

Unit economics sanity 

Tie unit prices to your marginal costs: LLM tokens, proxy minutes, Playwright runtime, storage, SMS. 

Target 70–80% gross margin per unit on average after scale; start conservative with quotas to learn real costs. 

Add circuit breakers: per-user daily and monthly caps; per-org rate limits; anomaly detection on usage spikes. 

Security, compliance, and ethics 

No sale of PII; no ads; opt-in sharing only where required for applications. 

Human-in-loop for extraction and landing-page content. 

Bias audits for predictive scoring; show transparent reason codes; allow user feedback. 

Terms: student confirms authorship of final essays; tool is coaching, not impersonation. 

COPPA/FERPA aware: 13+ signup; school integrations behind DPA/FERPA agreements. 

Phased build and timeline (12–16 weeks to first meaningful release) 

Weeks 1–2 

Replit monorepo setup; environments and secrets. 

App 1 skeleton: source registry, Scrapy + Playwright runners, proxy rotation, ToS scanner MVP.

App 3: onboarding, matches feed (eligibility only), save/dismiss, email alerts. 

Stripe metered basics; free credits; usage capture for essay/autofill placeholders. 

Observability and cost dashboards; kill switches. 

Weeks 7–8 

App 3: essay assistant v1 (outline + feedback), vault, planner v1. 

App 2: collaborative filtering minimal; ranking hybrid online. 

Bias checks and rationales for scoring labels. 

Weeks 9–10 

App 4: provider onboarding, verified listings, schema validation, basic analytics. 

Autofill v1 for partners via API; PDF pack export. 

Landing page generator v2 with quality gates; expand coverage. 

Weeks 11–12 

Harden ToS risk handling; expand scrapers; add dedupe heuristics. 

Security review; rate limits; cost caps; legal review. 

Pilot with 2–3 schools and 10–20 providers. 

KPIs aligned to usage model 

Students: WAU/MAU; % with completed profiles; free credits consumption; conversion to top-ups; cost per active student; applications started/completed; essay assistant NPS. 

Providers: active orgs; listings/updates; applications processed; screening calls; net revenue/org; churn. 

Data quality: extraction precision/recall; % listings with verified links; average time-to-update after deadline change. 

Growth: SEO organic visits; landing page conversion; counselor referrals. 

Risk controls 

Cost spikes: per-user/org caps; dynamic model selection (switch to cheaper LLMs when possible); batching and caching; off-peak crawling. 

Legal: keep ToS scanner conservative; partner-first ingestion; clear audit logs and contact channels for takedowns. 

Model drift: continuous sampling, evaluator benchmarks, human audits; rollback models quickly. 

SEO: quality-first; no thin or duplicative AI content; strict provenance and last-updated stamps. 

Team to start 

1 data/platform engineer (scraping + pipeline) 

1 ML/NLP engineer (NER/RE, CF, scoring) 

1 fullstack engineer (Next.js + API) 

0.5 ops/legal/privacy (contract) 

0.5 content QA/curation (contract) 

What launches first 

An ad-free, precise search with eligibility-only matching (free), SEO pages to feed it, and an essay assistant + planner with free credits (students), plus verified provider listings (free) and optional API/screening usage for providers. From there, iterate toward predictive scoring, autofill breadth, and deeper school/provider integrations. 

This plan keeps students’ incentives aligned (no ads, no PII sale), uses your NLP/graph moat, and replaces subscriptions with transparent, usage-based fees only when expensive AI/automation is actually consumed.
