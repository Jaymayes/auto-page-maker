🔎 STRICT BROWSER E2E PROTOCOL (Playwright)ROLEYou are the Lead SDET. You MUST use a real browser (Playwright/Chromium) to test https://scholaraiadvisor.com.curl, fetch, or HTML-parsing libraries (Cheerio) are FORBIDDEN for navigation steps.CONTEXTThe user reports broken links and broken auth that previous HTTP-only tests missed.We need visual proof (Screenshots) and execution proof (HAR logs) of the failure.NON‑NEGOTIABLE RULESEngine: Playwright or Puppeteer.Mode: Headless is acceptable (Replit containers often require it), but Screenshots are mandatory.Evidence: You must generate BrokenLinkReport.csv and AuthFlowReport.json.PHASE 0 — COMPLIANCE INTERROGATION (MANDATORY)Answer these questions before running any tests:Why wasn’t a real browser used previously? (Did you lack binaries? Was it faster to use curl?)How will you run a browser now? (Confirm you will install @playwright/test and run npx playwright install chromium if missing).Confirm the policy: "HTTP-only testing is forbidden. I will use a browser."PHASE 1 — ENVIRONMENT SETUPExecute these commands if the environment is not ready:Bashnpm install -D playwright
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
PHASE 2 — TEST EXECUTION🔍 Focus 1: Broken Link Audit (The "Click" Test)Action: Scrape all <a> tags from the Homepage.Execution: Visit every link (depth=1) using the browser.Constraint: Wait for domcontentloaded.Failure Condition:HTTP 4xx/5xx.SPA Failure: HTTP 200 but the page body is empty or shows a generic "Application Error" overlay.Output: BrokenLinkReport.csv (Source, Text, Destination, Status, Notes).🔐 Focus 2: Auth Path Validation (The "Sign In" Test)Action: Find the "Sign In" or "Log In" CTA on the homepage.Execution: Click the button using Playwright (page.click()).Observation:Capture the Immediate Redirect URL. (Does it go to scholar-auth?)Capture the Final URL. (Do we land on a login form or an error page?)Screenshot: Capture auth-error.png if the final state is not a login form.Output: AuthFlowReport.json detailing the redirect chain.PHASE 3 — EVIDENCE COLLECTIONSave these artifacts to a ./test-results/ folder:home.png (Proof the site loads)auth-click.png (The state immediately after clicking Sign In)BrokenLinkReport.csvConsoleAndNetwork.har (Network logs for debugging)PHASE 4 — FINAL VERDICTProduce a summary table:CheckStatusEvidenceBrowser Used✅/❌Engine: [Playwright/Puppeteer]Homepage Load✅/❌Screenshot savedSign In Flow✅/❌Final URL: [Redacted]Broken Links[Count]See CSVVERDICT: [READY / BLOCKED]If BLOCKED: List the exact broken links and the specific Auth error (e.g., "Redirect loop", "404 on callback").
