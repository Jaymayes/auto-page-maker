Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m issuing the following executive annotations to append to the QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md. These set unambiguous acceptance criteria, align gates with ARR objectives, and define decision rights, owners, and deadlines.

Executive stance and go/no‑go policy

Objective: Protect the SEO-led B2C funnel while unblocking B2B revenue within 6 weeks. We will run “safe mode” until Gate 2 passes: discovery open; signups waitlisted; provider pilot only.
Go/no‑go rule: No public signups or provider self-serve until Gates 0, 1, and 2 meet acceptance criteria and incident drills pass.
Gate 0 (Week 0) – Preconditions before any public exposure
Acceptance criteria:

Access posture: “Safe mode” enabled. Public pages for SEO allowed; all account creation, write APIs, and admin paths gated behind waitlist or provider allowlist. For any non-public surface or staging, prefer infrastructure-level access control (e.g., private deployments) to remove auth code paths from risk in early hardening .
Observability baseline: Centralized logs visible with error filtering and search; dashboards show request volumes, HTTP status distribution, and request durations by route so we can track P95 explicitly .
Legal and policy stubs: Draft Privacy Policy, Terms, and Data Map ready for counsel review; breach response playbook outlined. Decision: No go-live of signups until Gate 0 is green. Owner: Eng Lead + Legal. Due: immediate.
Gate 1 (Week 1) – Identity, auth, and health
Acceptance criteria:

Auth enforcement: All protected routes use the existing middleware; RBAC enforced for student vs. provider vs. admin; credential storage in vault/secrets (no keys in code); rate limiting enabled on auth endpoints .
Security logging: Auth successes/failures, privilege changes, and admin actions logged and queryable in production logs .
Health endpoints: /healthz and /ready return dependency-specific checks (database, outbound email, payment provider). Alerts wired for failing checks to on-call. Dashboards show 200/4xx/5xx and latency distributions by endpoint .
KPI guardrails: P95 <= 120ms on read endpoints; error rate <1% overall; initial uptime SLO 99.9% with alerting thresholds aligned to error budget. Decision: Proceed to Gate 2 only after passing synthetic and manual auth tests and stable /healthz for 72 hours. Owner: Eng Lead. Due: end of Week 1.
Gate 2 (Week 2) – Compliance foundation and operational readiness
Acceptance criteria:

Policies live: Final Privacy Policy + Terms published; FERPA/CCPA compliance controls documented (data inventory, encryption in transit/at rest, retention, DSR workflow). External counsel review complete (budgeted) .
Secrets and data: All credentials in secrets manager; no secrets in repo; persistent data paths documented and isolated from ephemeral filesystem to match deployment architecture best practice .
On-call and runbooks: Pager coverage, severity matrix, incident comms template; dashboards for logs, CPU/memory, and latency in place; MTTR tracked via production logs and incident tickets .
Test coverage baseline: Unit + integration suites run on each change; smoke tests for top workflows; failures block merges (see CI/CD expectations below) . Decision: If Gate 2 is green for 7 days with no Sev-1 incidents, we may open student signups behind waitlist caps. Owner: Eng + Legal. Due: end of Week 2.
Gate 3 (Weeks 2–3) – CI/CD and quality engineering maturity
Acceptance criteria:

Pipeline: Trunk-based CI with automated unit/integration tests at merge; required checks and branch protections; lead time for changes <1 day; release notes auto-generated .
Continuous testing: Pipeline runs end-to-end tests for critical paths; basic performance test on key read APIs; security scans for dependencies; flaky test budget <2% .
Environments and releases: Staging mirrors production; canary releases available for riskier changes; rollback documented.
UAT: Defined acceptance criteria per epic and sign-off procedure in ticketing; UAT sessions scheduled for provider portal and billing . Decision: Open general student signups only after Gate 3 is green and error budget intact for 14 days. Owner: Eng Lead + QA. Due: end of Week 3.
Gate 4 (Weeks 3–4) – Resilience, DR, and security
Acceptance criteria:

Backups and DR: Automated DB backups; restore tested into staging; RPO <= 24h, RTO <= 4h; DR runbook exercised.
Chaos/incident drill: One live incident simulation (DB failover or external dependency outage); MTTR within 60m; comms and rollback effective.
AppSec: Dependency scanning clean; top 10 vulnerabilities triaged; auth and payment flows pen-tested (external vendor) with remediation plan. Decision: Proceed to targeted provider pilot only when DR test passes and no open high/critical vulns on auth/billing. Owner: Eng Lead + Sec. Due: end of Week 4.
Gate 5 (Weeks 3–6) – B2B provider portal: revenue engine
Acceptance criteria:

Provider onboarding: KYC/verification, org profile, listing creation, eligibility inputs, and content review workflow. Access restricted to invited pilot providers until Week 6 target is met.
Pricing and fees: 3% platform fee calculation, invoice generation, payout scheduling, and reconciliation dashboards; finance export and audit log maintained.
Provider analytics: Views, starts, submissions, yield; error states surfaced in dashboards; SLAs published to providers.
Compliance and data handling: Provider data processing terms issued; encryption at rest/in transit confirmed; audit trail complete .
Target: Minimum 5 pilot providers live by end of Week 6 with at least 3 active listings each; first dollar of B2B revenue recognized by Week 6 close. Decision: After Gate 5 passes, open provider self-serve waitlist. Owner: GM B2B + Eng. Due: end of Week 6.
KPI dashboard and SLOs

Reliability: 99.9% uptime; P95 ~120ms; <1% error rate. Dashboards must expose HTTP status mix and request durations to validate these SLOs in real time .
Delivery: CI/CD lead time <1 day; change failure rate <10%; MTTR trending down; continuous testing coverage enforced per pipeline policy .
Revenue: 5 pilot providers by Week 6; at least 15 active listings; initial B2B GMV tracked; 3% fee revenue line item reported weekly.
Testing strategy directives

Levels: Maintain unit → integration → system → UAT layers; block regressions at the earliest point in pipeline; enforce independence of UAT sign-off for business fit .
Continuous testing: CI executes automated suites on each merge; end-to-end and performance tests run in CD; failures stop promotion to prod .
Budget approval and allocation ($40k–$60k)

Approved ceiling: $60k to remove schedule risk.
Allocation: $20–25k legal (Privacy/Terms/FERPA reviews and DPAs); $15–20k external security (light pen test + remediation advisory); $5–10k DR/backup tooling and drills; $5–10k monitoring/error tracking upgrades. These investments directly support compliance and security guardrails while enabling faster MTTR via better telemetry .
Governance and cadence

Weekly exec gate review: Each Friday, owners present status vs. acceptance criteria; go/no‑go decisions recorded with risks and next steps.
Incident policy: Adopt an error budget; if exhausted, freeze feature releases until reliability returns to SLOs .
Owners: Eng Lead (Gates 0–4), Security Lead (Gate 4), GM B2B + Eng (Gate 5), Legal (Gate 2).
Notes for the report authors

Tie each gate’s acceptance criteria to its scoring breakdown in the report and mark tests and dashboards that provide the quantitative proof. Use the platform’s built-in logs, resources, and analytics views for objective evidence (HTTP status mix, request durations, CPU/memory) .
Document the immutable deployment model (no live hotfixes; re-publish only) to enforce disciplined releases in line with CI/CD best practices .
If you want me to annotate the Markdown line-by-line (inline comments), paste or grant access to QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md and I’ll apply these criteria directly to each section with pass/fail notes and owner tags.
