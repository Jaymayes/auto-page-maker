Acknowledged. QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT v1.2 is accepted as the Gate 0 canonical baseline. We remain in NO-GO until quantified GREEN across all Gate 0 criteria, zero Sev-1s in last 7 days, and weekly burn ≤ $60k.

Executive approvals and directives

Scope and posture: Maintain NO-GO. Safe Mode triggers and red lines stand as written. $60k weekly burn cap approved.
Last-mile asks: Proceed with all 8 DRI deliverables due EOD Thursday; B2B one-pagers due 4:00 PM Thursday.
Decision cadence: CEO pre-read Thursday 8:00–10:00 PM with must-fix comments by 10:30 PM. Friday 30-minute, data-only, binary Go/No-Go.
What I need by Thursday 6:00 PM (single evidence pack)

Links to the 5 live dashboards:
Reliability & Delivery: Uptime; P50/P95/P99 latency; error rate; MTTA/MTTR; error budget burn.
B2C Growth: WAU/MAU; activation; free→paid; ARPU; retention; SEO indexation; CAC split with organic as primary driver.
B2B Pipeline: Active providers; listings/week; time-to-first-listing; 3% fee realized and run-rate.
Finance: Weekly burn vs plan by category; runway; variance; >3σ anomaly alerts.
AI Quality: Bias test coverage/pass rate; model cards; guardrail checks; transparency surfacing.
On-call readiness: Roster with backups; evidence of <5-minute ack from two live alerts this week; paging route diagram.
DR restore: Calendar invite on my calendar, restore runbook + RTO/RPO plan, proof of last successful restore and scope.
Growth/SEO: Top 50 pages list with instrumentation checks, schema/canonical tags confirmed, 7-day indexation tracker; pre-filled RCA hypotheses if indexation <60%.
Engineering reliability: Error budgets per service; latency distributions (P50/P95/P99); current auto-blockers and owners.
Revenue instrumentation: Demonstrate $0.01 sandbox transaction end-to-end; verify 3% provider fee and ARPU observability; >3σ anomaly alert enabled.
AI Quality: Named AI Quality Steward; bias test plan and schedule; model card template; academic-dishonesty guardrail test outputs.
Legal: Workback schedule with dated milestones for Privacy/TOS/FERPA/DPAs; engagement letter on file; explicit risk callouts with mitigations and owners.
Friday executive spot checks (I will run or observe)

Reliability: Random 3 endpoints meet P95 ≤120ms and ≤1% error; verify 2 paging alerts acked ≤5 minutes.
Delivery: Walk canary + rollback runbook; show a non-prod rollback executed this week.
DR/Backup: Validate restore scope and RTO/RPO checklist with a dry-run demo artifact.
B2B: Deep dive on the two target providers; confirm DMU mapping and day-by-day close plan through next Friday.
Revenue: Trigger $0.01 sandbox transaction; confirm 3% fee and dashboard update in near real time.
Growth/SEO: Random 5 of top 50 pages for analytics, schema, canonical, and indexation proof.
AI Quality: Review bias test spec, model card template, and issue-handling SLA.
B2B close plan guidance (due Thursday 4:00 PM)

For each of the two target providers: DMU map; last touchpoint; day-by-day close plan with “give/get”; blockers with owner/unblock date; accelerators that do not compromise unit economics; signing probability and expected first 30-day listing volume.
Financial and operating guardrails

Spend: ≤$60k/week, variance flagged in Finance dashboard with owner and explanation.
CAC: Bias to organic SEO via Auto Page Maker; any paid experiments must show sub-60-day payback and not degrade organic efforts.
Profitability: Maintain 4x markup on AI services and 3% provider fee assumptions in dashboards; alert on deviations >3σ.
Risks I’m actively tracking this week

SEO indexation <60% for the top 50 pages. If triggered, content generation freeze + formal RCA.
Time-to-first-listing >14 days. If triggered, GM B2B corrective action plan within 48 hours.
On-call ack >5 minutes or SLO breach. If triggered, Safe Mode with RCA in 24 hours and freeze on non-critical features.
Missed DR test. If triggered, preemptive NO-GO and block provider onboarding.
Accountability and communication

Daily 2-minute EOD signal starting Friday 6:00 PM: top risks, blockers, thresholds breached/approaching, owner/ETA.
Single source of truth remains QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT v1.2; append all evidence links in a “Gate 0 Evidence” section by Thursday 6:00 PM.
If any deliverable is at risk by Wednesday 5:00 PM, escalate to me and propose a mitigation plan with an alternate path to still achieve a clean Friday decision.
Decision bar reminder

GO requires: all seven Gate 0 criteria GREEN with quantitative evidence, zero Sev-1s in last 7 days, and burn ≤ plan. Otherwise, Safe Mode (max 1 week), DRI-owned remediation, daily standup, re-review next Friday.
Proceed. I expect calendar invites for: DR restore drill, canary+rollback demo, and Friday Gate 0 decision.
