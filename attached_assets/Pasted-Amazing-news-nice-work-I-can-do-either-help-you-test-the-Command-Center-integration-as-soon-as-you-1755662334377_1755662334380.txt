Amazing news—nice work! I can do either: help you test the Command Center integration as soon as you add the secrets, or start on a few high‑impact enhancements. Your call.

If you want to test now, here’s a tight checklist:

Add Replit secrets (confirm names from your doc; typical set below)
COMMAND_CENTER_BASE_URL
COMMAND_CENTER_API_KEY (or TOKEN)
AGENT_NAME and/or AGENT_ID (if static IDs are supported)
CALLBACK_BASE_URL (public URL Replit exposes for webhooks/callbacks)
WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET (if applicable)
QUEUE_NAME or TOPIC (if required)
POLL_INTERVAL_MS, MAX_CONCURRENCY, HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC
LOG_LEVEL, ENV
2. Restart the app and watch logs for:

“Agent registered” with agent_id
“Heartbeat ok”
“Subscribed/Listening” (queue/topic)
3. Smoke tests I’ll walk you through:

Registration: confirm agent presence in Command Center
Heartbeat: last_seen updates
Task lifecycle: create a test task, observe start/progress/complete
Failure path: trigger a controlled error and confirm retries/DLQ or backoff
Shutdown: SIGTERM drains in-flight work and marks agent offline
4. Security/validation checks:

Webhook signature verification rejects bad signatures
401/403 for tokens without required scopes
Config validation fails fast on missing/invalid env
If you prefer I can prep you a quick command/script checklist to run locally and you can paste the results back here for verification.

If you’d like me to keep building, suggested next features (prioritized):

Reliability and safety
Exponential backoff + jitter, max attempts, and a dead-letter queue
Idempotency keys for task execution
Graceful shutdown with in‑flight draining and lease extension
Circuit breaker around Command Center calls
Observability and ops
Structured logs with correlation IDs
Health/ready endpoints and a /metrics endpoint (Prometheus-friendly)
Basic alerts (Slack/email) on registration failure, heartbeat gaps, DLQ growth
Redaction of PII in logs
Security and config
Config schema validation on boot with clear error messages
Secret rotation procedure and short-lived tokens
Principle-of-least-privilege scopes for the API key
Productivity and DX
A “pause/resume” control from Command Center
Priority queues and concurrency per task type
Admin dashboard card showing agent status, queue depth, error rate
Postman collection or small CLI for common ops; an example task catalog
Docs/runbooks
Architecture + sequence diagram
On-call runbook: playbooks for common failures
Environment matrix (dev/staging/prod) and config guide
