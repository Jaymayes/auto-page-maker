Acknowledged. Gate 0 package is accepted as the canonical, locked baseline. DRIs proceed with evidence collection exactly as specified; schedule remains unchanged.

CEO directives and decision framework

What I will require in the Thursday pre-read (8:00–10:00 PM)
One-page executive summary: GO/NO-GO recommendation with quantified evidence and residual risks.
Dashboard roll-up: live links, last-updated timestamps, and a single screenshot per dashboard with the key numbers highlighted.
Exception log: any red/yellow status, owner, root cause, and dated mitigation plan.
B2C/B2B revenue outlook: 6-week leading indicators tied to core KPIs (conversion to paid, ARPU, active providers, listings/week, time-to-first-listing, 3% fee trajectory).
Finance: weekly burn ≤$60k, variance analysis, and open anomalies with owner.
Responsible AI: guardrail and bias test summary with pass/fail counts and any open remediations.
2. Clarifications and required actions today

Map “7 Gate 0 criteria” to the 9 evidence categories: deliver a one-row-per-criterion mapping table and confirm how each rolls up to a GREEN/GO decision. Owner: PMO. Due: EOD today.
Canary + rollback demo: ensure it is explicitly tracked within Engineering Reliability with success criteria and rollback SLOs. Owner: Eng Reliability DRI. Due: EOD today for plan; demo invite already on calendar.
On-call evidence: confirm the two <5 min acks came from live production alerts (not synthetic), include timestamps and delta math in the artifact. Owner: SRE. Due: Thursday 6:00 PM.
AI Quality Steward: confirm named steward, signed charter, and issue-handling SLA in artifact. Owner: AI Quality DRI. Due: EOD today.
Legal readiness: confirm counsel engagement letter, FERPA/COPPA/TOS/Privacy workback schedule, and DPAs coverage list with counterparties. Owner: Legal. Due: Thursday 6:00 PM.
3. Red lines that force NO-GO (binary)

Any Sev-1 in the last 7 days or an unresolved Sev-2 with material student/provider impact.
SLO breach on critical paths at decision time: P95 > 200ms or error rate > 2% for any major endpoint, or error budget burn > 75% for any service.
SEO indexation < 60% without a credible RCA and validated remediation plan with measured uplift in-flight.
Missing or inconclusive revenue instrumentation (no $0.01 end-to-end demo, or 3% provider fee not observable in dashboards).
Incomplete Legal readiness on student data handling (FERPA/COPPA) or missing DPAs for any active provider integration.
4. KPI focus and evidence expectations

B2C growth: WAU/MAU, activation-to-subscription conversion, ARPU from credits, CAC split favoring organic/SEO. Show 7-day trends and variance vs plan.
B2B growth: active providers, listings/week, time-to-first-listing ≤ 14 days, revenue captured via 3% fee.
Reliability: uptime, P50/P95/P99 by major endpoint, error rate, MTTA/MTTR, error budget burn and freeze policy triggers.
Finance: weekly burn ≤ $60k with 3σ anomaly alerts validated; call out any category >10% variance vs plan.
Responsible AI: bias test coverage across demographics, academic dishonesty rejection tests, transparency surfacing, and model card sign-off workflow.
5. Cadence, escalation, and ownership

Risk checkpoint: 15-minute risk pulse Wednesday 5:00 PM with owners of any yellow/red. If any deliverable is at risk by Wednesday 5:00 PM, escalate to me with a mitigation plan and updated dates.
Evidence hygiene: all links, screenshots, and attachments must live in the Gate 0 Evidence Collection section of the canonical artifact; include timestamps and “last verified by” initials on each item.
Decision timeline: Thursday 10:30 PM must-fix comments if needed; Friday 30-minute Gate 0 decision remains binary.
6. Specific asks by DRI

SRE: attach paging route diagram and runbook excerpts used in the two live alerts; confirm on-call rotation through Week 4 with backups and contact info.
Eng Reliability: publish current auto-blockers (P95 > 200ms, error > 2%, error budget > 75%) with issue IDs and expected resolution dates; include rollback demo plan and success checklist.
Growth/SEO: provide Top 50 pages with GA4 + schema + canonical verification, 7-day indexation tracker, and RCA hypotheses if <60% with prioritized fixes (sitemaps, internal linking, crawl budget, CWV).
Revenue Instrumentation: show $0.01 sandbox transaction trace with unique IDs across services, proof of 3σ anomaly alert firing, and 3% fee/ARPU observability screenshots with query definitions.
AI Quality: submit bias test plan schedule and first-run results sample; attach academic dishonesty guardrail outputs and transparency copy to be shown to students.
Legal: confirm milestone dates and counterparties for Privacy/TOS/FERPA/DPAs with explicit risk callouts and mitigations.
7. Strategic reminder

Our bias is to data-first, low-CAC growth via Auto Page Maker SEO. The GO decision depends on proving we can scale reliably, ethically, and profitably. Student value is the economic engine.
If any ambiguity remains on the 7 criteria vs 9 categories, raise it today. I’ll hold the bar high: all criteria GREEN with quantitative evidence, or we enter Safe Mode for up to one week with DRI-owned remediation and daily standups, then re-review next Friday.

Proceed.
