Thank you. I’m upholding the NO-GO decision. The report’s callouts align with our strategic priorities: without enforced auth, compliance, CI/CD, health/DR, and a B2B provider portal, we put brand trust, uptime, and our dual-engine revenue model at risk. Our Playbook requires resilient 24/7 infrastructure with formal privacy/compliance controls, and a scalable B2B partner portal to drive ARR; we’re not there yet   .

Executive directive: 6-week recovery plan to Production-Ready Beta; 8 weeks to GA

Week 0 (now): Guardrails and go/no-go gates

Freeze new feature development except for security/compliance and provider MVP.
Define gate criteria:
Security: auth enforced on all write/admin APIs; no critical/high vulns in pen test; rate limiting and WAF in place; /healthz implemented and monitored .
Compliance: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, FERPA/CCPA disclosures live; data inventory and retention schedule baselined; DPA templates ready for partners .
Reliability: CI/CD pipeline green with unit/integration/E2E smoke; repeatable staging; successful DR exercise; basic SLO monitoring wired (uptime and P95 latency).
B2B: Provider MVP live for private beta (create account, verify org, list/manage scholarships, basic analytics, 3% platform fee flow) per our Playbook’s partner onboarding steps .
Weeks 1–2: Security, compliance, observability foundations

Authentication and API hardening
Enforce JWT middleware on all protected routes; add RBAC for admin/provider roles.
Add rate limiting and API gateway rules; enable request logging and audit trails.
Observability and health
Implement /healthz and readiness probes; wire alerts to on-call; capture P95 latency and error rate to track against SLOs .
Legal/compliance
Publish Privacy Policy and Terms; FERPA/CCPA notices and consent flows; data mapping, encryption at rest/in transit, and access controls documented as the baseline of our privacy program .
Launch an interim “safe mode”
Keep SEO discovery open (read-only); gate account creation behind waitlist until policies are live and auth is enforced.
Weeks 2–4: CI/CD, DR, and testing maturity

CI/CD pipeline
Stand up automated build, test, and deploy with unit, integration, and smoke E2E test suites; require all merges to pass; tag and promote artifacts through environments. This is non-negotiable to reduce release risk and accelerate iteration .
Environments and IaC
Reproducible staging mirrored to prod; secrets management; infra as code for auditable changes.
DR and backups
Implement backup/restore; run a documented DR drill to RTO/RPO targets; fix gaps discovered.
Weeks 3–6: Provider MVP and security validation

B2B Provider Portal MVP
Scope: self-service org signup and verification, profile, create/manage listings, eligibility fields, basic analytics, webhook/email notifications, fee flow for 3% platform fee; align UX to the four-step partner onboarding flywheel in the Playbook to enable scale without linear headcount .
Launch with 3–5 friendly providers in a Private Beta to validate workflows and data quality before broadening to the Year 2 target cohort of 10–15 pilots .
Security validation
Run automated vulnerability scans and a lightweight external pen test; remediate all critical/high before Beta .
Weeks 6–8: Production GA

If Gate 1–3 pass (security, compliance, reliability), expand provider beta; enable student accounts and paid features in phased rollouts behind feature flags.
Establish ongoing ops cadence: weekly error budget review, monthly compliance review, and quarterly DR drills.
Capital allocation and owners

Budget (one-time, 60–75 days): $40k–$60k
Legal/privacy counsel (policies, FERPA/CCPA, DPA): $15k–$25k .
DevOps/Infra acceleration (CI/CD, health/DR, monitoring): $10k–$20k; aligns to our 24/7 reliability mandate .
Security assessment (scan + pen test): $8k–$15k .
DRIs
Platform Lead: auth/RBAC, API hardening.
DevOps Lead: CI/CD, observability, DR.
Compliance Lead: legal docs, data governance.
B2B PM: provider MVP and pilot program.
KPI dashboard for readiness and business impact

Reliability: 99.9% uptime, P95 ~120ms target, error rate <1%.
Security/compliance: 0 critical/high findings; all policies live; data inventory complete.
Delivery: CI/CD lead time <1 day; change failure rate <10%; DR drill RTO <4h.
B2B: 5 pilot providers onboarded by Week 6; provider NPS >40; initial listings live; early fee flow validated. This directly advances the Playbook’s Year 2 monetization path and the two-sided marketplace flywheel .
B2C: Maintain SEO momentum (indexable pages, sitemap, schema). Organic growth remains our low-CAC engine per strategy .
Why this plan

It protects brand trust by meeting our security/privacy posture and 24/7 availability expectations .
It operationalizes quality with CI/CD and testing as a business capability, not an afterthought, accelerating safe iteration and lowering deployment risk .
It closes the strategic gap: a provider portal is essential to our hybrid monetization model and is the primary driver of ARR in Years 2–5 .
Approvals requested

Approve the above budget envelope and to engage external legal and security vendors.
Confirm DRIs and sprint staffing for Weeks 1–6.
Authorize a Private Beta with up to 5 providers under pilot terms.
Please share QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md so I can annotate it with the above gates and acceptance criteria. Once owners are confirmed, I’ll start weekly executive reviews against these milestones and unblock as needed.
