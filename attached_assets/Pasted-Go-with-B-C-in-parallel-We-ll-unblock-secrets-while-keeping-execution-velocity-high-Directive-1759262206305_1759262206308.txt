Go with B + C in parallel. We’ll unblock secrets while keeping execution velocity high.

Directive

B) Confirm and fix environment loading now (timebox: 45 minutes)
C) Proceed with non-secrets Phase 2 tasks in parallel (timebox: remainder of the day)
B) Secrets verification and env-loading fix

Replit Secrets panel
Ensure these keys exist (case-sensitive):
AGENT_BRIDGE_SHARED_SECRET
SHARED_SECRET (duplicate the bridge secret here for backward compatibility)
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
Remove any trailing spaces/newlines. Save.
2. Code expectations

Client/browser code must read GA via import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID (not process.env).
Server/agent code should read the bridge secret via process.env.AGENT_BRIDGE_SHARED_SECRET || process.env.SHARED_SECRET.
3. Rebuild to inject Vite envs

Stop the dev server completely.
Clear Vite cache: remove node_modules/.vite if present.
Restart “Run” so Vite rebundles with the current env.
If production build, do a clean build so import.meta.env gets re-inlined.
4. Quick diagnostics (dev-only)

Add a temporary route or console output that reports presence (true/false, masked) of:
AGENT_BRIDGE_SHARED_SECRET
SHARED_SECRET
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID via import.meta.env on the client
Remove before pushing to production.
5. Validation criteria

Agent Bridge health check responds 200 with auth.
Command Center orchestration ping succeeds with secret auth.
Browser console confirms GA initialized with a valid measurement ID.
Fallback if not resolved in 45 minutes

Create a local .env.local for development with the same three keys (ensure it’s gitignored). Keep Replit Secrets as the source of truth and remove .env.local once the panel-based injection works.
C) Phase 2 tasks that don’t require secrets (start immediately)

Performance

Establish Lighthouse CI baseline and set budgets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, TBT < 200ms on mid-tier device).
Enable code-splitting and prefetch for top routes. Verify P95 route transitions ~120ms target.
Add basic Web Vitals logging to console for local profiling.
Test automation

Playwright smoke tests: landing → search → scholarship detail; form validation with mock data; navigation and 404 coverage.
Snapshot tests for core components to guard against regressions.
SEO (Auto Page Maker)

Generate and publish 25–50 high-intent scholarship pages using existing templates.
Ensure canonical tags, meta, schema.org/Scholarship markup, XML sitemap updates.
Observability scaffolding

Stub an analytics interface that safely no-ops if GA is unavailable, so we can swap in real GA when secrets land without code changes.
Why this path

Minimizes schedule risk: secrets can be fickle with build-time injection, so we parallelize.
Advances our low-CAC, SEO-first growth engine today.
Protects security posture: we use Replit Secrets first; local .env.local is a short-term fallback only.
Confirming responsibilities and timing

You start B and C immediately.
Post back within 45 minutes on the env status (success or fallback in place) and share the diagnostics results (no secret values, just pass/fail).
Continue Phase 2 tasks through EOD so Day 3 momentum is preserved.
If you prefer A, I’ll authorize it only if B fails within the 45-minute window. Do not post secrets here; use the Replit Secrets panel.
