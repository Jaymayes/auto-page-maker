Decision: Prepare staging deployment for measurement now, with a parallel branch ready for bundle optimization if metrics don’t clear the gate.

Rationale

We’ve made low-risk, additive improvements that can materially improve real-world FCP/LCP. Validate with RUM before spending 2–3 hours on bundle surgery.
The 75KB JS gate is important, but its impact on FCP/LCP is likely smaller than the already-shipped CSS/compression wins. Measure first; optimize second if needed.
Timeline: We need signal by Wednesday AM to make a Thursday noon status. Measurement tonight de-risks the schedule.
Execution Plan

Tonight (immediately)

Deploy to staging/preview with the current state.
Kick off Lighthouse CI mobile runs (Android, Slow 4G, 5–9 runs; use median). Capture filmstrips and trace.
Verify GA4 + enhanced Web Vitals are flowing in staging. Record p50/p75 FCP/LCP.
Open a “ready” branch for bundle work (don’t merge yet):
Lucide: switch to per-icon imports (lucide-react/icons/{name}), confirm sideEffects: false paths, and prevent dynamic icon names; add a transform-imports or babel plugin if needed.
Radix: import only used primitives, drop unused packages, and lazy-load heavier components (Dialog/Popover) behind interaction.
Add/verify bundle analyzer and produce before/after artifact.
Wednesday morning

Review metrics from staging:
Go to canary if ALL hold: FCP p75 ≤ 2.4s, LCP p75 ≤ 2.8s, CLS ≤ 0.1, TBT ≤ 300ms (lab), main JS gz ≤ 90KB, no error-rate regression.
If any fail OR FCP p75 > 3.0s: immediately execute the bundle PR (Lucide + Radix) to hit ≤ 75KB gz. Re-deploy to staging and re-run Lighthouse.
Wednesday afternoon

If post-optimization metrics clear gates, proceed to 50% canary. Monitor GA4/Web Vitals and error rates for 2–4 hours, then roll to 100% if stable.
Gates and Non-negotiables

Main JS gz: target ≤ 75KB. If not achieved, we require FCP p75 ≤ 2.4s to proceed; otherwise optimize bundle first.
Core Web Vitals: FCP p75 ≤ 2.4s, LCP p75 ≤ 2.8s, CLS ≤ 0.1. INP trending ≤ 200ms on interaction-heavy views.
Stability: No increase in client error rate; SLOs unaffected.
Assignment

You: Deploy to staging now and trigger Lighthouse CI. Open the “ready” optimization branch with scaffolding (don’t merge).
Tomorrow 9:30am ET: Post metric snapshot (p50/p75 FCP/LCP, Lighthouse median, bundle size).
If thresholds missed: Merge optimization by 12pm ET Wednesday, remeasure by EOD.
Answer to your question

Prepare staging deployment for measurement now.
In parallel, prep (but don’t merge) the Lucide/Radix bundle-optimization branch so we can execute immediately if the numbers don’t clear the gate.
