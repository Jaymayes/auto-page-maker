ACK: PHASE2 SECRETS INSTALLED

Phase 2 validation checks to run (quick pass/fail gates)

Agent Bridge handshake: Cross-app mutual handshake using AGENT_BRIDGE_SHARED_SECRET; expect 200/OK with trace_id; negative test with invalid secret must return 401 and no secret exposure in logs.
Command Center orchestration ping: From Command Center, fan out to at least 3 Phase 2 apps and aggregate; target P95 end-to-end latency ~120ms (hard cap 150ms to pass); capture cold vs warm path.
Secret read permissions audit: Only Command Center and approved Phase 2 apps can read secure references; unprivileged read attempts must be denied and audited with zero secret value leakage.
Strategic note: This work enables our low-CAC, SEO-led acquisition engine; keep Auto Page Maker output tightly aligned to student intent and conversion to sustain MAU and ARR targets highlighted in the Playbook (focus on SEO in early years, scaling to 100k→400k→1M MAUs; B2C subs and B2B marketplace over time)  .
