Acknowledged. Gate 0 package received and executive-ready. Thank you.

Executive decisions and directives

Status: Maintain NO-GO at Gate 0. Proceed only when the exit criteria below are met.
Budget: Approve $60k (allocated $50k + $10k contingency). Contingency requires an ROI memo per use.
Canonical artifact: QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md is the single source of truth; version control and weekly updates required.
Gate 0 exit criteria to move to Safe Mode

Dashboards live and paging tested:
Reliability + Delivery + Growth + Revenue dashboards wired to production telemetry with alerts enabled (error rate, P95 latency, request duration, HTTP status mix; lead time, change failure rate, MTTR; SEO pages/indexation/traffic; B2B pipeline/3% fee revenue). Monitoring must include request durations, status code mix, and error logs to support rapid MTTR reduction .
On-call drill: one live paging test with <5 min ack and documented postmortem.
DR/Backup: One successful restore test meeting RTO ≤ 4h and RPO ≤ 24h with screenshots/logs attached in the report.
Legal: Engagement letter signed; first drafts of Privacy, Terms, and DPA in progress with milestones scheduled.
Release discipline: Immutable deploy runbook and rollback playbook completed; “no hotfixes; redeploy only” reaffirmed.
B2B pilot readiness: 2 signed pilot LOIs, 5 active providers in late-stage pipeline with listing templates finalized.
Responsible AI: Ethical testing checklist baselined; an “AI Quality Steward” named to own bias, transparency, and explainability validation for models (role charter in the report). This aligns to modern QA practice recommendations for AI-centered quality ownership .
14‑day targets (data-first baselines)

Reliability/Delivery
Availability ≥ 99.9%, P95 latency ≤ 120ms, error rate ≤ 1% sustained; change failure rate ≤ 15%; MTTR ≤ 30 min. Continuous testing in CI/CD is mandatory to hit these targets and reduce lead time-to-change risk .
SEO growth engine (low-CAC priority)
Auto Page Maker velocity: publish 200 net-new pages; 60%+ 7‑day indexation; instrument impressions/CTR for the top 50 pages.
B2C funnel
Landing → signup conversion ≥ 5%; instrument activation and first-value events; set baseline free→paid conversion to track once credits are enabled.
B2B pipeline
20 qualified prospects; 8 discovery calls; 2 signed pilots (toward 5 providers and 15+ listings by Week 6).
Revenue instrumentation
End-to-end tracking for the 3% provider fee and ARPU from credits; weekly cohort views for free→paid.
Capital allocation (initial caps; stay lean)

Observability/dashboards/alerting: up to $8k (tools + setup) to ensure production telemetry and error budgets are enforceable .
DR/backup + first restore tests: up to $12k (storage, runbooks, rehearsal).
Legal (Privacy/Terms/DPA): up to $15k (external counsel).
SEO Auto Page Maker content/infra: up to $10k (indexation and velocity).
B2B pilot enablement (listing ops, templates, CRM hygiene): up to $5k.
Contingency: $10k locked; release per ROI memo tied to a measurable KPI lift.
Risk directives (top 5)

DR not tested pre-pilots: Critical until the first successful restore; must land by Week 3.
AI bias/ethics: Gate 3 mitigation plan must include test evidence and model cards signed by the AI Quality Steward .
Performance regressions: Block release if P95 > 200ms for >10 minutes or error rate > 2% for >5 minutes; auto-freeze features on error budget exhaustion.
Pilot provider churn: Require weekly pipeline health review; implement listing velocity SLAs per provider.
Legal schedule slip: Lock a weekly workback plan with counsel and owners.
Approvals and asks before Friday’s Gate 0 review (30 minutes, timeboxed)

Engineering Lead
Publish Grafana/Datadog (or equivalent) links in the report; enable alert policies for error rate, P95, request duration, and HTTP status mix with on-call routing tested .
Submit release runbook and rollback procedure; schedule and complete one on-call drill.
DevOps
DR policy finalized; schedule first restore test and place proof in the artifact.
GM B2B
Attach the provider pipeline spreadsheet; include counts by stage and listing velocity targets.
Legal
Confirm retained counsel and deliverable dates for Privacy/Terms/DPA.
QA
Testing strategy mapped to CI/CD gates; publish coverage, flaky test rate, and change failure rate on the Delivery dashboard, consistent with continuous testing best practices .
Scheduling

Please send the calendar invite for this Friday, 30 minutes, CEO + 6 DRIs, with links to:
QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md (canonical)
Four dashboards
DRI roster with escalation tree
One-page risk register
Gate 0 acceptance checklist
Reminder on operating philosophy

Data-first decisions; student value drives revenue; prioritize scalable organic growth via Auto Page Maker; stay lean and autonomous; act with urgency.
Once the above preconditions are met and verified in the dashboards and artifact, I will authorize moving from NO-GO to Safe Mode.
