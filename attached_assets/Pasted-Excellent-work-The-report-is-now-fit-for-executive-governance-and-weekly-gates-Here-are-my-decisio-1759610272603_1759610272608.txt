Excellent work. The report is now fit for executive governance and weekly gates. Here are my decisions and directives to move us from NO-GO to controlled pilots while protecting our reliability, security, and brand.

Executive decisions

Status: Maintain NO-GO. We will not enter Public Beta or GA until Gate 4/5 criteria are fully met with quantitative evidence.
Budget: Approve the $60k allocation with a $10k executive contingency held back for emergent risks. Release of contingency requires a DRI-written ROI memo.
Canonical artifact: QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md is the single source of truth for gate decisions and status. Version it and capture each gate outcome with evidence links.
Immutable deployment policy: Reaffirm “no live hotfixes; re-publish only.” This aligns to the snapshot/redeploy model and reduces operational risk during scale-up, as documented in the Replit deployment workflow where updates require a new publish snapshot .
Gate cadence and exit criteria

Weekly executive gate review: 30 minutes, timeboxed. Agenda: SLOs and error budget, delivery KPIs, risk register deltas, revenue progress, decision requests.
NO-GO to Safe Mode (Private Beta) exit criteria:
Reliability: 7-day rolling SLOs green with P95 ≤120ms and <1% error rate; instrumentation in place using the platform’s request-duration and HTTP status analytics, with alerting tied to error budget policy .
Delivery: CI/CD lead time <1 day and change failure rate <10% over 14 days; automated tests gate merges and deploys per continuous testing best practice .
Security: Secrets management, TLS in transit, and service-to-service auth verified in staging; keys in vault/secrets and no secrets in code, with HTTPS enforced by default on published apps .
Compliance: FERPA/COPPA review complete; DPA/ToS/Privacy ready for pilots (final legal sign-off at Gate 2).
Safe Mode to Private Beta, Private Beta to Public Beta, Public Beta to GA: proceed only with clean error budgets and zero Sev-1s in the prior 7 days, and with completed restore drills (see DR below).
Instrumentation and evidence

Dashboards required by Gate 0:
Reliability: Uptime, P95 latency, error rate; wire up request-duration and status code views for quick triage and trend analysis .
Delivery: Lead time for changes, change failure rate, MTTR; enforce automated tests across unit→integration→system→UAT as core quality gates in CI/CD .
Growth: SEO pages published per week, indexation rate, impressions/clicks; B2C conversion funnel; B2B provider pipeline and conversion.
Revenue: ARPU from credits, free→paid conversion, 3% provider fee revenue.
Error budget policy: Monthly downtime budget 0.1%. If exhausted, freeze feature releases until burn-down via reliability fixes, consistent with immutable, redeploy-only updates .
B2B pilot directives (Weeks 0–6)

Targets: 5 signed pilot providers, 15+ active listings, first B2B revenue by Week 6 (as you’ve set).
Offers and pricing: Maintain 3% platform fee; publish a simple pilot MSA + DPA packet at Gate 1 to accelerate signing.
Pipeline ops: GM B2B owns a weekly pipeline report with top-of-funnel leads, LOIs, signed, listings live, and time-to-first-listing. Tie this to provider-facing “immutable” release notes so partners see reliability discipline, not churn .
B2C growth directives

SEO is the primary acquisition engine; maintain the “Auto Page Maker” velocity. Weekly reporting on content throughput and indexation.
Technical SEO: ensure fast TTFB and P95 response time (supports rankings and UX). Use performance analytics to spot latency regressions early .
Security, compliance, and ethics

Secrets and auth: All inter-service traffic authenticated (API key or better), secrets in platform vault, no plaintext in code; HTTPS by default confirmed .
Responsible AI: Add an ethical testing checklist to UAT covering bias, transparency, and data handling for any AI-driven recommendations. This aligns with industry guidance to test AI for fairness, bias, and transparency and will be a trust differentiator in our category .
DR/backup and cloud posture

DR: Daily backups for stateful services; define RTO ≤4h, RPO ≤24h. Run a quarterly restore drill. Record results in the report.
Off-ramp: Maintain a Git-based bridge for rapid redeploy to external hosts if needed (e.g., a critical incident or cost/scale pivot). Have a “Plan B” runbook for Vercel/Render/Netlify to reduce vendor risk .
Testing strategy thresholds

Coverage and quality bars by Gate 1: unit test coverage targets agreed per service; integration/system suites automated; UAT scripts cover critical student and provider journeys, consistent with modern continuous testing practice in CI/CD .
Release governance

No hotfixes in production; redeploy only after tests and checks pass, per the snapshot publishing model. Reinforce this in the runbook and in on-call training to keep MTTR low without bypassing controls .
Deliverables for Gate 0 review

Links to all dashboards above, plus error budget alerting configured to on-call rotation.
DRI roster with escalation tree and pager schedule.
Legal: Draft DPA/ToS/Privacy packet for pilot-ready review.
B2B: Provider pipeline with dates to 5 signed pilots and 15+ listings.
DR: Backup policy and first restore test scheduled.
Release runbook: Immutable deploy steps, rollback playbook, and communication templates.
Risks I’m flagging now

Incident risk during pilots without fully burn-tested DR: mitigate with restore drill before onboarding provider 1.
Ethical/brand risk in AI recommendations: mitigate with the Responsible AI UAT checklist noted above .
Performance regressions from content velocity: mitigate with tight monitoring of request durations and automated perf tests in CI/CD .
Scheduling

Please calendar the first Gate 0 executive review for this week. Include the dashboard links, DRIs, and a one-page risk register with top 5 risks (likelihood x impact, owner, mitigation).
This plan preserves our reliability posture, reduces CAC via SEO-first growth, and gets us to early B2B revenue without jeopardizing trust—exactly the discipline we need on the path to category leadership and profitable ARR.
