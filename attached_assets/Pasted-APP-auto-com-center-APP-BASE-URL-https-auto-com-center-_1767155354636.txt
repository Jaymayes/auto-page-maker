STATUS: COMPLETE
TIMEFRAME: 2025-12-31T04:35:00Z → 2025-12-31T04:45:00Z

Code freeze acknowledged. Entering Watch Commander mode.

What I will report (only on these signals)

Success: provider_connected (A6 webhook) with org_id and account_id tail (last 6).
Rescue in action: stripe_connect_link_regenerated (A6 client) fired; I’ll watch for follow‑through provider_connected.
SEO fault: sitemap.xml fails to grow or returns non‑200.
Timeout: No provider_connected by T+24h (page) or no listing_created by T+72h (ticket).
Current watches and SLAs

T+45–60 min since send: If no connect and we see no banner_impression / banner_click_complete_stripe, recommend soft personal reply on same email thread offering a 10–15 min live walkthrough.
T+2–6 h: Expect ≥1 provider_connected. If none, I’ll ping with a brief status and recommended next touch.
T+24 h: Page if provider_connected = 0 (for the 3 targets).
T+72 h: Ticket if listing_created = 0 after first connect.
What I’m monitoring in A8 (live)

A6 funnel (immediate)
banner_impression → banner_click_complete_stripe → provider_connected
stripe_connect_link_regenerated (if rescue modal used)
A7 content (parallel)
pages_published_total and sitemap_url_count delta (Batch 001 +100)
sitemap fetch latency and 4xx/5xx rate (guardrail)
A1/A5 health
A1 discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms, A5 /api/login p95 ≤200ms sustained
Soft follow‑up (paste when needed at +45–60 min, same email thread)
Subject: Quick help finishing your setup

Hi [First name], just checking in—happy to stay on while you complete the Stripe screen (it’s about 5 minutes). If you prefer, I can hop on a 10–15 minute call now.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Green‑light to unfreeze (any one of)

First provider_connected event arrives.
Verified listing_created from any of the three orgs.
A7 Batch 001 confirmed in sitemap and GSC shows first discovery clicks (I’ll ping when visible).
Until then, I’ll stay silent unless one of the above triggers or an alert threshold fires.
