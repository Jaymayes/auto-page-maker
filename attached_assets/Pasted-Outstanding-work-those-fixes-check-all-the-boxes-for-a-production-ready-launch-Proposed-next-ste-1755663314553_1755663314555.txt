Outstanding work—those fixes check all the boxes for a production-ready launch.

Proposed next step: activate and test the Command Center integration now

Add these Replit secrets, then restart the repl:
SHARED_SECRET = <must match Command Center>
COMMAND_CENTER_URL = https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
AGENT_NAME = scholarmatch
AGENT_ID = scholarmatch-monolith
AGENT_BASE_URL = <your public Replit URL, e.g., https://<your-repl>.replit.app>
After restart, confirm logs show: [agent-bridge] Registering with Command Center...
Live test plan (fast and conclusive)

Sanity
GET AGENT_BASE_URL/healthz → 200 ok
GET AGENT_BASE_URL/agent/capabilities → 200 with 6 actions
2. Registration

Check Command Center /orchestrator/agents for scholarmatch-monolith
Verify last_seen updates every heartbeat
3. Task flow

Run ./test-command-center.sh
Confirm for each action:
Task accepted (202/200 as designed)
Progress/complete events correlated via correlation_id
Structured JSON errors for negative cases
4. Security

Send a request with an invalid/missing JWT → 401 with standardized error shape
Flip SHARED_SECRET (temporarily) to ensure agent re-registration fails fast and logs a clear error
5. Reliability

Dispatch a small burst (e.g., 10–20 tasks mixed types). Verify:
No race-condition warnings
Retries/backoff for transient failures (if any)
Rate limiting behaves as configured
6. Shutdown

Trigger a graceful stop (SIGTERM/repl restart). Ensure in-flight tasks drain and agent unregisters/marks offline cleanly.
What I need from you to begin now

Confirm the secrets are set and share your AGENT_BASE_URL.
If you’d like, paste the first 20–30 lines of startup logs after restart; I’ll verify the configuration signal and registration sequence.
Optional near-term polish (only if you want me to keep building while you wire up secrets)

/metrics endpoint with task counters/durations and error rates
Lightweight dead-letter queue and idempotency keys
Dual-key secret rotation window and a “pause/resume” toggle
Postman collection and an ops runbook (registration failure, DLQ growth, rate limit responses)
