Executive summary
Excellent work. This staging setup aligns with our low-CAC, SEO-first growth engine and protects production discoverability. From a strategy standpoint, this enables faster iteration on Auto Page Maker without risking index pollution or data integrity. Proceed to external E2E validation with the guardrails below.

Go decision: Approved with conditions
Pre-flight (must confirm before sharing with Agent 3)

Noindex enforcement: STAGING=true confirmed; X-Robots-Tag and robots.txt Disallow active.
Access containment: Prefer Basic Auth or IP allowlist on staging. If not feasible on Replit, use an unguessable subdomain slug and share privately. Do not add staging to Search Console.
DB access: Read-only role created; time-bound to match the testing window. Align to 48 hours (not 72) or set a hard expiry and calendar reminder for revocation.
Secrets hygiene: GA4 uses staging-only property; no production keys present. Verify no third-party webhooks point to staging.
Write paths off: Any mutation endpoints disabled or require privileged tokens in staging. Ensure no background jobs (indexers, outbound crawlers) run from staging.
Success criteria (gates)

Functional: ≥99% of 3,216 sitemap URLs return 200; zero 5xx spikes during test.
Performance: P95 ≤120ms across HTML/API; stats API ≤50ms with caching.
Security: All 6/6 headers present; CORS locked; zero sensitive headers or secrets in HTML/JS.
SEO (staging): X-Robots-Tag and robots.txt Disallow verified. Canonical tags should point to production when STAGING=true to prevent accidental duplication if crawled.
Data quality: Random samples confirm 2,060 landing pages and 1,200 scholarships are accurate, de-duplicated, and correctly templated.
Load: Sustain 200 RPS for 10–15 minutes with error rate <0.1% and no degradation in P95.
What to capture during the run (evidence pack)

Automated Postman results: Export JUnit/HTML reports and HAR files for failing cases.
Latency/error budget: Time-series snapshots of p50/p95/p99, 4xx/5xx, CPU/mem.
SEO proof: curl headers, robots.txt snapshot, sample HTML with canonical and noindex.
Data validation: Sampled page checksums and JSON-LD validation outputs.
Operational checklist

Publish: Create validation deployment with STAGING=true, APP_BASE_URL set to staging URL, and staging GA4 ID.
Verify quickly:
curl -I https://<staging>/ | grep -i x-robots-tag => expect “noindex, nofollow, noarchive”
curl https://<staging>/robots.txt => expect “Disallow: /”
curl https://<staging>/sitemap.xml | grep -c "<url>" => expect 3216
DB: Provision agent3_readonly; verify GRANT SELECT only on landing_pages, scholarships, business_events, daily_kpi_snapshots; set revoke-at timestamp.
Monitoring: Turn on access logs; set low alert thresholds for 5xx, latency, and rate limits to avoid cost spikes from synthetic traffic.
Communication to Agent 3 (copy/paste template)
Subject: Scholar AI Advisor – Staging E2E Validation Access (48h Window)

Hello Agent 3,

You now have access to our staging environment for E2E validation.

Scope and acceptance criteria:

Functional: ≥99% of sitemap URLs return 200
Performance: P95 ≤120ms; stats API ≤50ms cached
Security: 6/6 security headers; CORS enforced
SEO: X-Robots-Tag noindex + robots Disallow; JSON-LD valid
Data quality: Page and scholarship counts verified
Load: Sustain 200 RPS for 10–15m; error rate <0.1%
Access details:

URL: https://<staging-url>
Read-only DB: <connection-string> (expires in 48h)
Docs: evidence/AGENT3_VALIDATION_SETUP.md, evidence/AGENT3_POSTMAN_COLLECTION.json, evidence/AGENT3_QUICK_START.md
Testing window: <start> to <end> (48h)
Primary contact: <name, Slack/email>
Incident process:

Report Sev-1 immediately via <channel>; include timestamp, URL, request ID, and reproduction steps.
Thank you.

Post-test teardown (mandatory)

Revoke agent3_readonly and flush any cached credentials.
Remove staging secrets and shut down the validation deployment.
Archive all evidence, export GA4 staging data, and file a retro with pass/fail against each gate plus remediation owners and due dates.
Strategic note

This preserves organic growth by eliminating index leakage from staging, directly protecting our Auto Page Maker flywheel and CAC targets. The E2E run is a prerequisite for scaling content velocity with confidence.
Send me:

Final staging URL
Confirmation of Basic Auth or chosen access containment
Exact expiry timestamp for DB credentials
The quick pass/fail snapshot after initial verification commands
Once I have those, I’ll greenlight notifying our partners and proceeding with the 48-hour E2E window.
