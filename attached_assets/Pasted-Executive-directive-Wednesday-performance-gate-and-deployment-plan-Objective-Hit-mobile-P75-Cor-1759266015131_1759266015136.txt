Executive directive: Wednesday performance gate and deployment plan

Objective
Hit mobile P75 Core Web Vitals gates on the specified test profile to protect SEO-driven growth and conversion:

FCP P75 ≤ 2.4s
LCP P75 ≤ 2.8s
Schedule and owners (ET)

9:00–9:10 am — QA runs WebPageTest as specified (Dulles, Chrome Mobile, Moto G4, Mobile 3G Slow, 5 runs).
9:40 am — QA compiles results: sorted FCP/LCP arrays, selects 4th values (P75), attaches test links/screenshots, exports CSV.
9:45 am — Perf posts a 1‑page summary to Slack: FCP P75, LCP P75, LCP element, TTFB, total transfer size, main thread long tasks, and any render‑blocking resources.
10:00 am — Go/No‑Go.
Decision logic

If BOTH gates pass:
Approved: Canary rollout at 2:00 pm (10% → 25% → 50%). Hold at 50% overnight; evaluate RUM. If stable, plan 100% Thursday 10:00 am.
If EITHER gate fails:
Execute bundle optimization immediately (Lucide tree‑shaking + Radix pruning), rebuild, and re‑test by 12:45 pm.
If re‑test passes gates: Canary at 2:00 pm per above.
If re‑test still fails: No deploy. Roll to Thursday with escalated optimization options.
Pre‑authorization and prep

Based on dev metrics (FCP/LCP 5.1s dev, minus ~1.5s production delta → ≈3.6s), we are likely to miss at least one gate. To avoid delay:
Perf prepares but does not merge an optimization PR by 10:30 am (icon whitelist + Lucide selective imports, Radix component pruning, verify tree‑shaking). If tests pass, close PR; if fail, merge immediately.
Target bundle ≤75 KB gz (current 87.98 KB gz). Expect 12–15 KB gz reduction from Lucide/Radix work, which should shave ~100–250 ms off LCP on Moto G4 3G Slow.
Rollout guardrails (2:00–3:00 pm)

Real‑time monitors: error rate, 95th latency, CPU/memory, and live RUM FCP/LCP P75 deltas vs control.
Automatic rollback trigger: 10‑minute sustained regression >10% on LCP P75 or >25% error rate increase versus baseline.
Code freeze at 3:00 pm is firm. If we have not reached stable 50% by 3:00 pm, hold at last safe percentage until Thursday 10:00 am.
Reporting format (post each test)

FCP (5 runs, sorted) → P75
LCP (5 runs, sorted) → P75
PASS/FAIL against gates
LCP element and source (image URL or text node), TTFB, total bytes, blocking resources
Links to WebPageTest result, CSV export, and filmstrip
Compliance and risk

Validate no regressions to accessibility and CLS (target remains near 0.001).
Maintain SLOs (99.9% uptime, ~120 ms P95 server latency).
Confirm no changes compromise Responsible AI commitments or data handling.
Why this matters

Faster mobile P75 directly improves SEO (low‑CAC acquisition), on‑site conversion to paid/credits (B2C), and provider confidence (B2B), advancing our $10M profitable ARR goal.
Action items now

QA: Kick off WPT at 9:00 am and prepare the summary by 9:45 am.
Perf: Stage the optimization PR by 10:30 am (no merge unless gate fails).
DevOps: Prep canary toggles, monitoring dashboards, and rollback playbook.
PMM: Hold announcements until we are stably at 50% with green RUM.
Post results here by 9:45 am ET with the exact P75 numbers and PASS/FAIL so I can issue the 10:00 am go/no‑go.
