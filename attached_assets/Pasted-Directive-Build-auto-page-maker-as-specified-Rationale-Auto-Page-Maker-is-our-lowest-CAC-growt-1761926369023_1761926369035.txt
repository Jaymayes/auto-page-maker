Directive: Build auto_page_maker as specified.

Rationale: Auto Page Maker is our lowest-CAC growth engine and the fastest path to compounding organic acquisition. Shipping this first aligns to our Prime Directive and KPI focus on SEO-driven B2C funnel growth.

Scope and acceptance criteria

Output: Programmatically generate and publish SEO-optimized scholarship landing pages at scale (initial target: 1,000 pages in week 1; 10,000 pages by week 3), with templated meta, schema.org, internal linking, canonicalization, robots.txt, XML sitemaps, and clean URL structure.
Deployment pattern:
Static Deployment for the content site to leverage global CDN speed and clean rewrites/headers/404 page control.
Autoscale Web Service for content generation APIs and admin endpoints (spikes handled; cost-effective scale-to-zero).
Scheduled Deployment for nightly refresh/rebuild jobs (deadline rollovers, taxonomy updates).
Publishing workflow: Use Replit’s snapshot “Publish” model with Workflows for build/rebuild tasks; no state on the published filesystem; all secrets via Replit Secrets; all persistence via DB, not local storage.
Observability: Enable Replit web analytics for Autoscale services (page views, top URLs/referrers, status codes, request durations). Configure logs and resource dashboards for runtime visibility.
Performance/SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 <120ms on API endpoints; static pages Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90; first byte < 200ms on CDN; automated 404/500 dashboards.
Admin + safety: Authenticated admin endpoints to trigger category rebuilds, purge/regenerate sitemaps, and rollbacks. Secrets rotation through Replit Secrets; zero hard-coded tokens.
SEO quality guardrails: Duplicate-content avoidance via strict canonical rules; schema for FAQ/Breadcrumb/Article as applicable; thin-content thresholds; auto internal-link graph; sitemap index sharding once >50k URLs; auto 301s on slug changes.
Analytics/KPIs wired: UTM capture on CTA, events for impressions → signup → credit purchase funnel; organic clicks, pages indexed, CTR, CVR to signup, and ARPU dashboards.
Deliverables and timeline

Day 3: Working generator + 100-page pilot live on a staging domain; sitemaps/robots; initial analytics wired.
Day 7: 1,000 pages live on production domain; autositemap index; nightly refresh job; admin endpoints.
Day 21: 10,000 pages live; full taxonomy coverage; quality and indexation monitoring; performance tuned.
Required inputs to begin

Domain and subdomain mapping (e.g., pages.scholaraiadvisor.com) and DNS access for custom domain setup.
Initial taxonomy and prioritized keyword cohorts (categories, majors, locations, demographics, deadlines).
Brand voice/style guide and compliance guidelines for content tone.
Analytics credentials for GA4 and Search Console; event schema for signup/credit purchase.
Reporting cadence

Daily: Publish status, pages generated, errors, and P95 latency summary.
Weekly: SEO funnel metrics (indexation %, top URLs/referrers, CTR, signups from organic), plus risks/blocks.
Next step after acceptance

Once Auto Page Maker is live and indexing, we’ll sequence “Execute all 8 apps from v2.5” to support conversion, provider onboarding, and monetization. For now, focus exclusively on Auto Page Maker to maximize near-term organic lift.
Confirm receipt and start immediately. If any input above is missing, proceed with sensible defaults and stubbed data, then request only blockers that affect deployment.
