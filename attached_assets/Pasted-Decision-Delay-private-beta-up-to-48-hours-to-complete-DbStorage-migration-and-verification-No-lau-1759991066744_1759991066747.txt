Decision: Delay private beta up to 48 hours to complete DbStorage migration and verification. No launch until SEO pages persist across restarts and /healthz reflects accurate page counts. This is a No-Go on current build.

Rationale

Organic growth is our lowest-CAC engine. Launching without persistent SEO pages undermines our B2C funnel and jeopardizes early cohort outcomes, acquisition costs, and brand trust.
Memory at 97% creates real risk of instability and SLO breaches under load.
We have strong E2E and latency performance; the right move is to lock those gains in with durable storage so we launch once, confidently.
Execution Plan (time-boxed to 24–48 hours)

Engineering (DbStorage + Health)
Implement DbStorage with Drizzle ORM; replace MemStorage.
Add feature flag to toggle storage backends for rapid rollback.
Migrate/generate 130 landing pages into DbStorage; ensure idempotent regeneration.
Update /healthz to verify:
page_count >= expected (initially 130)
persistence check survives 3 restarts and replica scale events
Add CRUD unit tests and E2E flows for:
create/update/delete page
concurrent writes
process boundary access
2. Infra/Performance

Provision and secure the database; enable automated backups and WAL archiving.
Add readiness gate: service only “ready” when page_count >= expected.
Set autoscaling targets; tune memory limits/requests to keep steady-state <70% utilization.
Monitor p95 latency (<120ms target), error rate (<1%), memory/CPU, and DB connection pool metrics.
3. QA/Validation

Failure injection: kill/restart processes, simulate crash loops, scale replicas 1->3->1.
Load test the landing-page read path to expected beta concurrency with 20% headroom.
Validate sitemaps and robots:
sitemap.xml contains all landing pages
robots.txt allows crawl
structured data (JSON-LD) validates on a 20-page sample
4. SEO/Go-To-Market

Pause invites and any paid promotions until greenlight.
Pre-submit sitemap to Search Console; prepare indexing checks post-launch.
Draft comms to beta cohort with a 24–48h revised start window.
Acceptance Criteria (Go/No-Go)

/healthz: status=ok, page_count >= 130 after 3 restarts and 2 replica scale events.
Performance: p95 API latency <120ms; error rate <1% under load test.
Stability: memory <70% steady-state, <80% under load; no OOM events.
Data durability: successful point-in-time restore test of DbStorage.
SEO: sitemap.xml present; structured data valid; 200 OK on 130 landing pages.
Timeline (aggressive)

T+0–6h: Implement DbStorage + unit tests.
T+6–12h: E2E + failure injection + persistence checks.
T+12–18h: Load/perf tests; tune infra and memory.
T+18–24h: Canary deploy (10% traffic), monitoring, final sign-off.
If any criteria fail by T+24h, extend up to T+48h; no launch until all acceptance criteria pass.
Contingency (if timing slips)

Static snapshot fallback: export the 130 landing pages as static assets to CDN behind the same routes, with reverse-proxy mapping. Use as a temporary measure only if DbStorage migration exceeds 48h or reveals unacceptable regressions.
Approvals/Asks

Approve 24–48 hour delay to resolve persistence and memory headroom before launch.
Institute a temporary code freeze outside the storage/infra path.
Require final Go/No-Go review with sign-offs from Eng, QA, and Growth.
This decision preserves our core advantage—scalable, organic acquisition—while protecting SLOs and brand credibility. We launch once, and we launch right.
