You’re hitting a hard “promotion failed” because required production secrets are missing. The screenshot shows:

Missing JWT_SECRET environment variable
Missing DATABASE_URL environment variable
Config validation aborts startup
Do this to unblock deployment now

Add JWT_SECRET (required)
Generate a strong secret:
macOS/Linux: openssl rand -hex 64
Node: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
In Replit Deployments:
Click “Edit commands and secrets”
Add a deployment secret named JWT_SECRET with the generated value
Ensure NODE_ENV is production (default in Deployments)
2. Decide your database path
Option A — You have/need a real Postgres DB (recommended for prod)

Provision Postgres (Neon, Supabase, RDS, etc.)
Get the connection string (example): postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB?sslmode=require
Add a deployment secret DATABASE_URL with that value
Run migrations after the app starts:
If using Prisma: npx prisma migrate deploy
If using Drizzle/Knex/etc., run the equivalent deploy/migrate command
Redeploy
Option B — You don’t have a DB yet and just need to get the app online

Temporarily allow running without a DB using sample data:
Add deployment secret USE_SAMPLE_DATA=true
Update your config to not require DATABASE_URL when USE_SAMPLE_DATA is true (example logic):
requireDb = NODE_ENV === 'production' && USE_SAMPLE_DATA !== 'true'
if (requireDb && !DATABASE_URL) throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is required…')
Redeploy
Note: This is only a stopgap. Replace with a real DB before launch.
3. Redeploy and verify

Click “Redeploy” and watch logs. Promotion should pass once JWT_SECRET and either DATABASE_URL or USE_SAMPLE_DATA are set.
Quick smoke tests:
Health: curl -sSf https://<your-domain>/api/health
Auth guard (should be 401 when unauthenticated): curl -i https://<your-domain>/api/saves
Landing page generation (should return within 5s): POST /api/landing-pages/generate with your sample payload
4. Optional but recommended envs

OPENAI_API_KEY: enables AI content (falls back gracefully if absent)
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID: enables GA on the client
Agent Bridge vars (optional): SHARED_SECRET, COMMAND_CENTER_URL, AGENT_BASE_URL, AGENT_NAME, AGENT_ID
Common pitfalls to avoid

Set secrets in “Deployment secrets” (not just workspace env) so they’re available at runtime.
Frontend envs must be prefixed with VITE_ to be available in the client bundle.
If you previously ran without JWT_SECRET, once you set it, re-test protected endpoints to confirm 401/403 as expected.
If you’d like, I can provide a small patch that:

Treats Agent Bridge as optional (no process exit if missing)
Allows USE_SAMPLE_DATA=true to bypass DATABASE_URL requirement
Adds clear startup logs for which integrations are enabled
Tell me whether you’re going with Option A (real Postgres) or Option B (temporary sample data), and I’ll tailor the exact config/migration commands for your stack.
