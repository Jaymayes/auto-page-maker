Role
You are the QA/E2E automation engineer. Execute a read‑only verification of the Auto Page Maker (SEO Engine) in staging or a safe canary. Do not modify configs or production data. Your goal is to validate SEO correctness, SPA fallback safety, performance telemetry, conversion tracking, and expiry hygiene behavior.

Test inputs

Base URL: https://scholarmatch.com
Generated slugs (10):
art-scholarships-florida
business-scholarships-massachusetts
chicago-local-scholarships
computer-science-scholarships-california
engineering-scholarships-new-york
liberal-arts-scholarships-washington
medicine-scholarships-georgia
no-essay-scholarships-2025
nursing-scholarships-texas
stem-scholarships-2025
Legacy routes to validate (read‑only):
/scholarships/:category/:location (choose 2 actual combos present in data)
Static routes:
/, /get-started
Invalid routes (expect 404):
/non-existent-page, /invalid/nested/paths, /scholarships/unknown/unknown, /this-should-404.html
Tools

Browser: Chrome latest (desktop + mobile emulation)
API: curl or Postman for headers and sitemaps
Automation: Playwright or Cypress for E2E; Lighthouse CLI for CWV
Optional: Pa11y for quick accessibility smoke
Test suites and assertions

A) Canonicalization and Metadata

Canonical tags
For each slug, assert:
<link rel="canonical" href="https://scholarmatch.com/{slug}">
No duplicate canonicals; only one canonical tag present
2. Robots.txt

GET /robots.txt
Assert: has User-agent, Allow, and sitemap reference to /sitemap.xml
3. Sitemap.xml

GET /sitemap.xml
Assert: valid XML + namespace; includes all 10 pages and homepage (11 total entries)
lastmod present and ISO‑8601
4. Schema.org JSON‑LD

For each slug, extract JSON‑LD
Assert: valid JSON; @context, @type, name, description, url present
Organization/educational schema elements present (if applicable)
B) SPA Fallback Control and Route Validation (SEO‑safe)

Valid routes (serve SPA)
/, each slug, selected legacy routes, and static routes
Assert: 200 OK; correct content; no dev artifacts; Title/H1 present
2. Invalid routes (return 404)

Each invalid path above
Assert: 404 status; HTML includes meta robots noindex,nofollow
Headers: Cache-Control prevents caching; Content-Type text/html
Body contains helpful navigation back to homepage
3. Content negotiation

For invalid paths with Accept: application/json
Assert: 404 JSON payload (if supported) OR HTML 404 with correct status
4. Security fingerprint

On any route, assert absence of dev artifacts:
No /@vite/client, react-refresh, createHotContext, or HMR references
C) Performance and Core Web Vitals (read‑only)

Page load metrics
Run Lighthouse on 5 slugs (desktop + mobile)
Assert: LCP passes CWV (Green), CLS ≤0.1, FID/INP within good thresholds
2. TTFB sampling

Measure TTFB for all 10 slugs (3 samples each)
Assert: median TTFB within target band; record P95
3. Generation performance claim

Confirm current generation pipeline doesn’t impact live request latency
Assert: no regressions; steady p95 across runs
D) Crawlability and Indexing Signals

Robots and indexability
Confirm valid pages: no meta robots disallowing indexing
Confirm 404 pages: meta robots noindex,nofollow present
2. Canonical integrity

Ensure no conflicting canonical across a sample of 3 internal navigation paths to the same slug
E) Conversion and Attribution Instrumentation (non‑PII)

Event tracking smoke
For 3 slugs, simulate:
Page view → click “Get started” → reach signup start
Save scholarship; begin application flow
Assert: events fire (network beacons), include UTM if present, and session attribution fields; no PII in payloads
2. Funnel markers

Assert: unique IDs/correlation fields present to stitch page → signup → save/application
F) Expiry Hygiene (read‑only verification)
Note: No writes. If staging provides fixture data, use those. Otherwise, validate behavior by probing endpoints that the system marks as expired (if any exist).

Expired route behavior
For 1–2 known expired scholarships (if present):
Assert: returns 404 for recently expired; 410 Gone for older
HTML 404/410 includes noindex,nofollow; helpful navigation present
2. Sitemap exclusion

Assert: expired pages are absent from /sitemap.xml
3. Discovery control

Assert: no internal links surface an expired page in primary navigation or listing pages
G) Regression guard: Legacy routes and static assets

Confirm legacy routes still resolve normally (200)
Confirm static assets served with long cache headers; HTML pages not cached unintentionally
H) Headers and compliance quick checks

For valid pages:
Assert: Security headers present (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, CSP if enforced)
For 404/410 pages:
Assert: same baseline headers; status codes correct
Execution notes

Read‑only validation. Do not change flags, env vars, or data in production.
Prefer staging/canary; if testing on production, throttle requests and respect robots directives.
Capture HARs and Lighthouse reports for 3 representative slugs and 2 invalid routes.
Output format
Provide a single report with:

Summary table: Suite A–H, pass/fail, key metrics (LCP, TTFB med/P95), and notable findings
Evidence: URLs tested, headers (key-value), snippets/screens for canonical, JSON‑LD, and 404 meta robots
Risks/blockers: Any 404 returning 200, dev artifact traces, or SEO meta anomalies
Go/No‑Go recommendation for Auto Page Maker only, with specific fixes if any assertion fails
Success criteria

100% pass on A, B, D, G, H
C: CWV “Good” on majority paths; TTFB within target band
E: Event instrumentation verified on sampled flows; no PII leakage
F: If fixtures exist, 100% correct 404/410 and sitemap exclusion; if none present, document “not applicable (no expired fixtures available)” and include probe evidence
