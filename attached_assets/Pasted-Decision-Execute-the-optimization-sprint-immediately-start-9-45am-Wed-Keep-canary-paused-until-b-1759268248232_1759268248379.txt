Decision: Execute the optimization sprint immediately (start 9:45am Wed). Keep canary paused until bundle ≤75 KB gz and gates pass.

Authorizations and directives

Post comms: Use the exact messages you drafted for #perf-warroom and #release-channel. Approved as written.
Scope: Approved as proposed. No scope creep; no new features. Release branch is frozen except for the four optimization items.
Checkpoints:
12:00pm: ≤80 KB gz or escalate.
2:00pm: ≤75 KB gz or escalate.
DRIs:
Perf lead (D): overall delivery and bundle target
Frontend lead: lazy-loading + Radix pruning
Design/FE utility owner: icon proxy change
Analytics owner: script defer + attribution validation
QA lead: test plan and sign-off
Release manager: comms, gates, and ship/no-ship call
Gates to ship

Bundle: ≤75 KB gz (gzipped, canary artifact)
CWV lab proxies (10-run WebPageTest):
FCP ≤2.4s (median of medians)
LCP ≤2.8s
CLS ≤0.10
INP ≤200ms
Stability and quality:
No increase in JS errors vs baseline (Sentry) during dry run
Crash-free sessions ≥99.5%
No regressions to SEO-critical elements (canonical, robots, structured data)
Platform SLOs unchanged: 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency
Execution timeline (accelerated)

9:45am–12:00pm: Lazy-loading + Radix pruning; target ≤80 KB gz
12:00pm–2:00pm: Icon proxy + script defer; target ≤75 KB gz
2:00pm–3:00pm: QA pass (critical flows, SEO tags, analytics attribution)
3:00pm–4:00pm: WebPageTest (10 runs) + Lighthouse CI
5:00pm: Results review; final go/no-go set for Thursday AM
Ship window: Thursday evening or Friday 10am if all gates pass
Risk controls and contingencies

If 12:00pm checkpoint >80 KB gz: immediately expand pruning (dead code, tree-shake configs), and cut non-essential below-fold modules behind dynamic import. Escalate to CEO/CTO at 12:15pm with delta plan and new estimates.
If 2:00pm checkpoint >75 KB gz: no ship. Prepare hotfix plan to revert heaviest deltas or defer feature payload to next release.
Validate analytics defer does not break revenue attribution; if risk, fallback to data-layer buffer with idle callback.
Rationale

Protects CWV and SEO-led, low-CAC growth engine; aligns with our $10M ARR trajectory.
Enforces bundle discipline and avoids LCP regressions before they impact production.
Next steps right now

Post the approved messages to #perf-warroom and #release-channel.
Kick off sprint at 9:45am.
Meet for rapid review at 9:30am ET to confirm owners, checkpoints, and escalation protocol.
Status: CANARY BLOCKED; proceed with immediate optimization sprint.
