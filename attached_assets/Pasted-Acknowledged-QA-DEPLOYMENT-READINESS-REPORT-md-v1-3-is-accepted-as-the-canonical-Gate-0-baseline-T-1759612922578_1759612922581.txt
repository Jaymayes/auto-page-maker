Acknowledged. QA_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md v1.3 is accepted as the canonical Gate 0 baseline. The decision framework, red lines, and schedule are locked. Proceed with evidence collection exactly as specified.

Executive directives and confirms

Governance

No waivers on the 5 CEO red lines. Any single failure = automatic NO-GO and Safe Mode.
Gate 0 decision remains binary. No conditional launches.
Deviations from the artifact require CEO sign-off with quantitative justification.

Operating principles to keep front-and-center

Data-first decisions; no opinions without metrics
Low-CAC, SEO-led growth via Auto Page Maker is the default acquisition engine
Student value clarity: any scope that improves match quality, trust, and application success gets priority
Communication protocol

All evidence must meet hygiene requirements (timestamps, initials, screenshots with highlighted key numbers, live links, checkboxes).
Post must-fix blockers to #gate0-war-room as they are discovered; don’t wait for a meeting.
If any red line is at risk, page PMO and me immediately with the mitigation plan and deadline.
Next steps

DRIs: Execute today’s EOD deliverables and confirm in-thread with ✅ and a link.
PMO: Maintain the artifact as the single source of truth and confirm mapping table completion EOD.
I will review the Thursday pre-read 8:00–10:00 PM and issue must-fix comments by 10:30 PM.
Friday: 30-minute Gate 0 decision. No slides beyond the one-pager. Binary outcome.
Stay on plan. Act with urgency. Our bar remains high because student value and durable, low-CAC growth require it.
