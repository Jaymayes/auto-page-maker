Decisions and directives
- Platform remains NO-GO until Gate 0 on Fri Oct 10; zero waivers on the decision bar. This enforces our quality-first posture and aligns with our scale strategy toward market leadership and profitable growth outlined in the five-year playbook , and with modern CI/CD-driven QA rigor .
- PMO: deliver all T+60 items and pin by 18:00 UTC, then post the exact confirmation string:
  “5/5 posted+pinned; invites sent; examples live” with links
- All DRIs: post single-line ACKs (exact format) by 18:00 UTC. PMO to compile and pin the DRI roll-up by 18:10 UTC:
  “ACKs=<count>; AT-RISK=<count>; EXC-DRAFT links=<…>”
- QA Lead: by 18:00 UTC post/pin Sev-1 list with reproducible steps, alert battery status, and on-call rota; ensure inclusion on the QA Readiness dashboard.
- Exception Register: PMO + DRIs populate by 20:00 UTC; any item breaching T+60 or lacking owner/ETA should appear here immediately.
- Revenue 30/60/90 dashboard by 23:59 UTC (Revenue DRI + PMO). Minimum fields: B2C conversions, ARPU, B2B active providers, 3% fee run-rate, CAC trend, forecast deltas vs prior; add leading indicators from our SEO Auto Page Maker engine (indexed pages, impressions, clicks, leads) to reinforce low-CAC growth tracking that underpins the 10M ARR plan .

Operating cadence today (UTC)
- 17:30: PMO progress ping with links (mapping table + 4 dashboards stubs + calendar invites + run_id adoption examples).
- 18:00: T+60 deadline; PMO and DRI confirmations posted and pinned.
- 18:10: DRI roll-up posted; CEO spot check of QA Readiness dashboard and Sev-1/blocker list.
- 20:00: Exception Register posted/pinned.
- 23:59: Revenue 30/60/90 dashboard live.

Trigger conditions and pre-authorized actions
- If any of PMO 5/5, DRI ACKs, or QA Sev-1/battery/rota are missing at 18:05 UTC:
  - PMO: escalate owners in-thread and file an EXC-DRAFT per format with ETA ≤ T+120.
  - DRIs: convert EXC-DRAFT to EXC if unresolved by 20:00 UTC with explicit mitigation and ask.
  Example line to use if needed:
  [EXC-DRAFT]|run_id=20251004-1700-UTC-CEO-001|owner=<Name>|title=T+60 miss: <item>|impact=<User/Rev/SLO>|cause=<Known/Unknown>|mitigation=<Plan>|ask=<Decision/Resourcing>|eta=2025-10-04T20:00Z|evidence=<url>|ts=2025-10-04T18:05Z

Notes for Gate 0 preparation
- Dashboards must clearly show: SLOs (99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency), open P0/P1, pass/fail by suite, last-24h incident trend, and owned blocker list; Exception Register; and Revenue 30/60/90 as specified. This ensures the Gate 0 decision is data-first and student-value aligned, supporting our ARR plan and Responsible AI commitments  .

I will personally review the pinned artifacts at 18:10 UTC and again after 20:00 UTC. Keep updates data-only and in the standardized one-line formats.
