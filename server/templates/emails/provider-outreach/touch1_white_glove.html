  <p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

  <p>You started setting up {{OrgName}}'s scholarship on Scholar AI Advisor but didn't complete checkout. We can finish it for you this week.</p>

  <p><strong>What we'll do (no extra cost):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert your draft into a complete listing (eligibility, rubric, deadlines, payout info)</li>
    <li>Set up verification and formatting to our student-facing standard</li>
    <li>Publish and monitor quality; you review before it goes live</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why now:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Student demand is peaking and our traffic is predominantly organic/SEO-led, which means high-intent applicants at low operational cost.</li>
    <li>Our platform enforces Responsible AI and privacy-by-default for students; we never facilitate academic dishonesty and maintain strict COPPA/FERPA posture.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Quick next step:</strong><br>
  Reply "YES" and share a link to the prior draft (or attach your PDF/brief). Prefer a call? <a href="{{BookingLink}}" style="color: #2563eb;">Grab a 15-min slot here</a>.</p>

  <p>We'll deliver a ready-to-publish listing in 24–48 hours and keep your standard 3% provider platform fee model.</p>

  <p>Thanks,<br>
  {{AE_Name}}<br>

    P.S. Have multiple scholarships? We'll batch them—send everything once and we'll return formatted listings for your approval.
