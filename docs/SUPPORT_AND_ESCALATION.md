## 🐛 **How to Report Bugs Effectively**

### Good Bug Report (We Love These! ✅)

**Example**:
```
Title: "Save" button doesn't work on STEM scholarships

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Search for "Computer Science" scholarships
2. Click on "Tech Innovators Grant"
3. Click "Save" button
4. Nothing happens (no confirmation, scholarship not in "Saved" list)

Expected: Scholarship should be saved to my profile
Actual: Button grays out, then nothing happens

Browser: Chrome 118 on Mac
Time: Oct 9, 2025 @ 2:30 PM EST
Screenshot: [attached]
```

**Why It's Good**:
- ✅ Clear, specific title
- ✅ Reproducible steps
- ✅ Expected vs. actual behavior
- ✅ Environment info (browser, device)
- ✅ Screenshot included

---

### Bad Bug Report (Harder to Fix ❌)

**Example**:
```
Title: App broken

Description: The thing doesn't work. Fix it please.
```

**Why It's Bad**:
- ❌ Vague ("thing" = what?)
- ❌ No steps to reproduce
- ❌ No environment info
- ❌ Can't diagnose or fix without more details

---

### Best Practices for Bug Reports

**Do**:
- ✅ Be specific (exact error messages, not "it crashed")
- ✅ Include steps (how to reproduce)
- ✅ Add context (when, where, what you were doing)
- ✅ Attach screenshots/videos (visual = faster fix)
- ✅ Check if others reported it (search existing bugs)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Report multiple issues in one ticket (split them)
- ❌ Use all caps or aggressive language (we're on your side!)
- ❌ Assume we know your setup (tell us browser, device, etc.)
- ❌ Spam (one report is enough, we won't lose it)

## 🎯 **Common Issues & Workarounds**

### Issue: Can't Log In

**Possible Causes**:
1. Wrong password → Try "Forgot Password"

---

### Issue: "Save" Button Not Working

**Workaround**: Bookmark the scholarship page manually (browser bookmark)

---

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Possible Causes**:
1. Old browser → Update to latest version
